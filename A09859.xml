            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which made S. HIEROME call, the Liues of SAINCTS, the interpretation of holy ſcripture; and S.

            <p>Conſidering therefore and pondering oftentimes theſe things with my ſelf, I was much grieued, that in <note place="margin">Cauſes mouing the: Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour to write the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe lines.</note> theſe lamentable times (wherein our miſerable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is afflicted, ſpoyled, and oppreſſed by hereſie) the Catholicks amidſt theſe tribulations were depriued of the great profitt and conſolation which they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue by the reading of the Liues of their SAINCTS; becauſe that eyther their workes were not written, or yf they were written, it was in ſuch Authours that now are ſcarſe to be found, &amp; that in Latine, which is not for the capacitie of the vnlearned. I was noe leſſe grieued allſo that the SAINCTS them ſelues, that heretofore were the ornaments and Lights of our countrey, were now being vnknowne, depriued of their part of that due honour, which otherwiſe should haue beene done vnto them, being made knowne.

(ſeeing noe better writer would take ſoe worthie a work in hand) to trie my penne in behalf of our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious SAINCTS, and to ſett forth, though not as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily as I should, yet as truely and ſincerely as I could, the Liues of all the moſt renowned.

How great a man in all manner of learning, and chiefly in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall hiſtory as well of the vniuerſall Church, as of our <hi>English</hi> nation was Doctour <hi>Nicholas Sanders,</hi> it is well inough knowne to the world. He in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">Nicholas Sanders.</note> of his hiſtorie intituled, <hi>Of the English Schiſme,</hi> hath theſe words? <hi>Gregory the great ſent Augustine, Mellitus, &amp; other Monkes of S.</hi> BENEDICT, <hi>to the</hi> English Saxo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, <hi>who brought that nation from Idolatrie to Christianitie, and indued</hi> Ethelbert <hi>King of</hi> Kent <hi>with the baptiſme of Chriſt.</hi> And NICHOLAS <hi>Harpsfield<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> a man no leſſe skillfull
<pb facs="tcp:15374:11"/>
in the antiquities of <hi>England</hi> then SANDERS, in his Dialogue written againſt the <hi>Magdeburgenſes,</hi> and in other places of his workes confirmes the ſame veritie. But let the moſt illuſtrious Cardinall WILLIAM AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEN conclude this Controuerſie, who in an Epiſtle to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Monke of <hi>Caſſine</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> writeth theſe words: <hi>I could rehearſe vnto thy pietie</hi> (ſayth he ſpeaking of the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Order) <hi>manie things out of the histories of our nation of the great reuowne and Sanctitie of this Order, for both</hi> Sainct AVGVSTINE <hi>him ſelf, and the other diſciples of</hi> Sainct GREGORY, <hi>that conucrted the countrey to the Fayth, were all of this Order: and all the Monasteries first instituted (which Venerable</hi> BEDE <hi>mentioneth) and BEDE him ſelf, were of the ſame inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and all the Cathedrall Chapters, which in after times came to be of Secular Canons, were from their beginning of the Order of</hi> S. BENEDICT.</p>
            <p>Truely the authority of theſe three men, who in theſe later times were three fayre lights of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and ſecond to none in the knowledge of the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory, as their workes now extant doe declare, who had ſearched into all the anncient monuments and charters of <hi>England,</hi> deſerueth ſoe much creditt, that in reſpect of them, the opinion of anie other man whatſoeuer, may be neglected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned in this point. It remaynes therefore confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the authoritie of all the forenamed Authours that both S. GREGORY the great, and the Monkes he ſent to preach the fayth of Chriſt in <hi>England,</hi> were all of the holie Order and inſtitution of Sainct <hi>BENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DICT.</hi> For no man I thinke can be ſoe peruerſe (vnleſſe he be a profeſſed enemie to the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Order) as to forſake the aſſertion of ſoe manie, Holy, learned,
<pb facs="tcp:15374:11"/>
graue, wiſe, and prudent Writers both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> auncient and moderne, and follow the innouation and noueltie of one <hi>Baronius,</hi> whoſe arguments againſt vs are ſoe weake and whoſe coniectures ſoe vnlikely, that the whole ſtreame of his opinion ſeemeth rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſome other ſpring, then from the mind and learning of ſoe great a man. It would be too long to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them here. It shall ſuffiſe that ouer and aboue the foreſayd Authours and thouſands more, we haue the auncient and common tradition of the whole world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Him. It is a ſufficient, and more then a ſufficient anſwer for him, that our aſſertion hath been allwaies receaued in the Church for a truth euen ſince the time of ſainct GREGORIE him ſelf, yea and that all the whole ſtreame of antiquitie doeth conuince him of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouation in this poynt. Of which his miſtake I could eaſily pardon him, for allthough by ſeeking to robbe the <hi>Benedictine</hi> familie of ſainct GREGORY, he thought to haue done a diſparagement to the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet it fell out farre otherwiſe; for his deniall of a thing that had been alwaies before embraced for a truth in auncient times, moued manie learned men that zealed the Truth and good of the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to make a moſt exquiſite and ſtrict ſearch into the monuments and bowells of antiquitie, and finding that the opinion of <hi>Baronius</hi> was but a child that could by no meanes pretend anie title or right of deſcent from Authours of former ages, they ſoe learnedly, ſolidly, and manifeſtly made the contrarie aſſertion appeare to the world (to witt that ſainct GREGORY was indeed a monk of ſainct BENEDICT) that that which before lay, as it were, buried in antiquitie and not thought on receaued for a truth, but not talked on, knowne of all,
<pb facs="tcp:15374:12"/>
but commended but off a few, became more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous to the world, more glorious to the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Order, and more famouſly treated off throughout the whole Church: ſoe that the new opinion of <hi>Baronius</hi> ſerued but as a foyle more cleerly to ſett forth the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſainct GREGORIES being a <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monke, and to make the world take better and more particular notice, that ſoe great an <hi>Ornament</hi> of the vniuerſall Church had been brought vp in the ſchoole of ſainct BENEDICT.</p>
            <p>But that we may take away all further difficultie in this matter, let great ſainct GREGORIE him ſelf tell vs what Order he profeſſed, for ſurely no man can ſay but he is a iudge without exception, and one whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is able to weigh downe more then I will name of ſuch as write againſt vs. In his commentarie on the bocke of Kings, writing to his Monkes and Nouices, he vſeth in manie places the expreſſe words of ſainct BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NEDICTS <hi>Rule</hi> and applies them to expound the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly text, or rather makes vſe of the text it ſelf to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme the precepts of the <hi>Benedictine Rule:</hi> and there, in citing the words of the ſame Rule, he ſtileth our holy Father <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:15374:12"/>
doeth he not rather propoſe vnto them their Rules, and call S.

Surely yf ſainct GREGORY had been a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple vnto <hi>Equitius</hi> (as <hi>Baronius</hi> faynes) he could not haue beene ſoe vnmindfull of the Father of his mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall religion as to preferre ſainct BENEDICT be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, with the title of, the <hi>Beſt Maſter of regular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;</hi> and to propoſe his <hi>Rule</hi> to be obſerued by his Monkes, and not once in all his workes to make the leſt mention of the Rule of <hi>ſainct Equitius.</hi> But how could he, when neuer anie ſuch rule hath euer yet appeared vnto the world? But of his <hi>Best Maſter</hi> ſainct BENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DICT, he maketh ſuch honourable and large mention, that hauing diſpatched the life of <hi>ſaint Equitius</hi> in one short chapter of his Dialogues, he filleth a whole booke with the life vertues and miracles of our glorious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſainct BENEDICT, whoſe <hi>Rule</hi> he confirmed &amp; preferred before all others, to shew the abundance of loue which he bore vnto him, whom he ſtileth the <hi>Beſt Maſter</hi> of his monaſticall life. It would be too long to ſett downe here all the places of our holy Father's ſaint BENEDICTS <hi>Rule,</hi> which this great Doctour of the Church S. GREGORIE expoundeth to his Monkes in the aboue cited Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentarie on the booke of Kings, It ſufficeth for our purpoſe that he acknowledgeth S. BENEDICT for his <hi>Beſt Maſter,</hi> and propoſeth his <hi>Rule</hi> to be obſerued by the Monkes of his Monaſterie,
<pb facs="tcp:15374:13"/>
For what more manifeſt proofe can there be to shew that both he and the Monkes his ſubiects were all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Order, and that ſainct AVGV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINE our Apoſtle and his fellow-monkes &amp; preachers were profeſſou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of the ſame <hi>Rule,</hi> and Religion.</p>
            <p>Thus much (good Reader) I haue thought good to inſorme thee in this poynt, not becauſe the truth of the cauſe I defend did want anie ſuch proofes, but becauſe there are ſome ſoe willfully blind in the opinion of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius,</hi> that they doe yet ſtriue againſt the whole ſtreame of antiquitie and ancient Authours, and ſeeke to maintaine his noueltie. Againſt whom (If thou cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to encounter anie ſuch) thou art here ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to be able to ſpeake ſome thing for the truth in this matter. And doe not thinke that in diſputing this poynt againſt a man ſoe worthyly deſeruing of the Church as the moſt illuſtrious Cardinall <hi>Baronius,</hi> we doe it with intent to lay an aſperſion of diſgrace on his glorie, God forbid; for the defence of the truth can diſgrace noe man; and eſpecially him, who in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling through ſoe huge an Ocean as his Annalls are, could not choſe but erre in ſome things, leſt the world should haue taken him for ſome thing aboue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of mortall men. To conclude, we ſee that the greateſt part of our <hi>English</hi> SAINCTS are knowne all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoe to haue been of the holy Order of S. BENEDICT, as it appeares in the enſuing treatiſe of their liues. For the Catholick religion being firſt planted in <hi>England</hi> by the labours of S. AVGVSTINE &amp; his fellow-Monkes, who were all <hi>Benedictines,</hi> that holy Order was allſoe ſoe happyly rooted in the whole countrey, and ſoe manie learned and holy men were bred and brought vp in the ſame, that the whole <hi>English</hi> Church was
<pb facs="tcp:15374:13"/>
gouerned by the Profeſſours thereof, and replenished with great ſtore of SAINCTS of both ſexes of the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictine</hi> familie, there being noe other <hi>Rule</hi> of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar life but S.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of it to the Chriſtian fayth.

Their liues and of all others I haue endeauoured to ſett forth briefly with as great care as I could, deſiring thee for whoſe comfort I haue taken this paynes, to weigh the faults (yf anie thou chaunce to find) in the ballance of good will, and ſoe thou shalt not only encourage me to goe forward in this, and a greater worke then this, but allſoe oblige me to remayne thy friend, deſiring no other reward for my labours but thy prayers vnto the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe glorious SAINCTS, that I may in the end be made participant of their heauenly companie.

There was preſent with the Apoſtle in the Church a multitude of heauenly burgeſſes filling it with melodious muſick, and moſt fragrant odours. Hauing finished all the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ceremonies due vnto the dedication of a Church, he whom our Lord made a famous <hi>FISHER</hi> of men, returned to the <hi>Fisher</hi> of fishes, whom he found wonderfully amazed, and carried allmoſt beyond him ſelf with the flashes of the diuine ſplendour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">S.

Hauing drawne them on shore the Apoſtle bad him preſent that great one to Bishop MELLITVS in his name, and the reſt (ſaid he) take for thy reward.

Let him therefore forbeare from anie further dedication, and ſupplie only what we omitted, that is, to celebrate the moſt ſacred miſteries of our Lords bodie, and bloud, and with a ſermon to inſtruct the people, giuing them to vnderſtand that I will oftentimes viſitt this place, and be preſent at the prayers and petitions of the faithfull, promiſing to lay open the gates of heauen to all thoſe that ſpend their daies ſoberly, iuſtly, and piouſly in this world. The next morning the fisher with his great fish meets the Bishop MELLITVS as he was goeing to dedicate the Church, and makes knownes vnto him whatſoeuer was giuen him in charge by the Apoſtle. Whereat the Bishop much aſtonished entred into the Church, and finds the pauement ſigned with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> alphabet, the walls annoynted with holy oyle in twelue ſeuerall places, and the remnants of as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie wax ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dles faſtened to twelue croſſes, all things being yet moiſt, with the late ſpringling of holy oyle, and water.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:15374:33"/>
an almes in the name of God, and S. IOHN: He hauing nothing elſe in a readines, gaue him a ring of great value of his finger. Not long after two <hi>Englishmen</hi> going in pilgrimage to viſitt the holy ſepulcher at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> loſt their way, and wandered a long time throught ſtrainge, and vncouth places, till the ſunne goeing to ſett, the darkſom night approached, and encreaſed their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſoe that not knowing what to doe, nor which way to turne, there appeared a venerable graue old man that, brought them to a towne hard by, where they were receaued kindly, and entertayned very ſufficiently with diet, and lodging. The next morning as they were departing, the ſame old man putt them in their right way, and in takeing leaue of them, Brethren (ſayd he) be of good cheere, and doubt not but you shall returne to your countrey in ſafetie; for allmightie God will make your iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney proſperous, and I my ſelf for your good kings ſake will haue care to direct you in all your waies. For I am IOHN the Apoſtle who affect your King with all loue, for his pure vertue of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtetie <note place="margin">S.

Take therefore this ring which he gaue me for an almes, appearing in the habit of a pilgrim, and deliuer it vnto him againe, telling him withall that the time of his death drawes neere, for ſix moneths hence I will viſitt him, and bring him where togeather with me he shall <hi>follow the lambe which way ſoeuer he goeth.</hi> At theſe words he vanished away, and <note place="margin">Apoc. 14. v. 4.</note> they hauing viſitted the holy land returned ſafely into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and related orderly to the King what they had ſeene, and heard. And in teſtimonie of all gaue him the ring, which was afterwards kept with great reuerence as a holy relique in the great Church of <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> and by vertue of it, manie were cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the falling ſicknes, and of the contractions of their limmes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XXIII.</label> NOT LONG after the bleſſed man fell into a grieuous ſicknes, during which he was in ſuch an extaſie, that for the <note place="margin">S. Edw. in an extaſie</note> ſpace of allmoſt two daies he lay without anie ſigne of life. At length waking, as it were out of a deepe ſleepe he opened his eyes and ſitting vpp in his bed ſpake to the attendants in this manner. When in my youth I liued a banished man in <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi> I euer held the friendship and companie of good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perſons, as moſt deare and gratefull vnto me, and chiefly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15374:33"/>
thoſe Monks, and Religious men that excelled others in vertue and religion I obſerued, and with them I conuerſed moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly; among whom two Monks <hi>Benedictines</hi> had obliged me in the bands of charitie verle particularly vnto them, by their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <note place="margin">His loue to Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine Monks.</note> conuerſation, their holy life, their ſweet behauiour, and their affable and courteous diſcourſe. Theſe I more frequently viſitted, their diſcourſes being to my ſoule, as ſweet meates to my pallate. And theſe (being ſome yeares ſince tranſlated out of this world to the ioyes of heauen) I beheld in this my ſleepe ſtanding before my face, rehearſing (according to the will of God) what shall befall this countrey after my deceaſe. They ſay that the wickednes of the <hi>English</hi> nation is growne ſoe full, and to ſuch a height, that it prouoketh Gods wrath, and haſteneth his <note place="margin">His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of England.</note> reuenge. The Prieſts haue broken their. couenant with God, they handle the ſacred miſteries with polluted ſoules, and defiled hands. They are not true paſtours but mercenaties, that doe noe protect their flock, but expoſe it to the deuouring iawes of wolues, ſeeking only their owne priuate commoditie of the milke, and the wooll neglecting the good of their sheepe, that at laſt eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death may iuſtly deuoure and ſwallow both sheepe, and sheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard in the bottomleſſe pitt of hell. The Princes allſoe and gouernours of the land are vnfaythfull, companions of theeues, and waſters of the countrey, they neyther ſeare God, nor honour the lawes, men to whom truth is grieuous, and burdenſom, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſnes contemptible, and crueltie delightfull: ſoe that neyther the Prelates heare anie reſpect to iuſtice, nor the ſubiects haue anie regard of good order and diſcipline. And therefore our Lord <note place="margin">And the comeing in of the Normans.</note> hath drawne his dreadfull ſword, he hath bent and prepared his bow to shoote-forth the arrow of his iuſt wrath, and reuenge againſt this nation; into which he will ſend a miſſion of wicked ſpiritts, to whoſe power they shall be deliuered in one yeare and one day, to be punished with fier and ſword. With that, ſighing and grieuing at the newes of this calamitie threatned againſt my wretched countrey, (ô yee witneſſes of the heauenly ſecrets) ſayd I, what if this people beiog conuerted from their wickedenes shall doe worthie works of penance, will not God graunt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pardon, &amp; leaue his bleſſing among them? Penance is of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15374:34"/>
ſuch force that it ſuſpended the dreadfull ſentence of death pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by Gods owne mouth againſt the <hi>Niniuites,</hi> and allſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joan.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 21.</note> the imminent reuenge due to wicked <hi>Achab.</hi> Therefore I will perſwade my people to doe penance for their offences paſt, and carefully beware thoſe to come, and perhaps our Lord will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and not powre out theſe great calamities vppon them; but with his wonted pietie will receiue them then returned vnto his ſeruice, whom peruerted from him by their wicked life, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to punish and deſtroy with this heauie iudgement. No no (replied they) it will not fall out ſoe happily; for the hearts of this miſerable people are ſoe hardned, their eyes ſoe blinded, and their eares ſoe faſt dammed vp againſt all goodnes, that they will neyther hearken to anie correction, nor vnderſtand anie good counſell; they are neyther with threats terrified from euill, nor with benefits prouoked vnto good. At theſe their words my grief, and care en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, What (ſayd I) <hi>will our Lord shew his anger for euer? will he not at laſt beginne to be more pacified?</hi> When then shall ioyes ſucceed theſe ſoe manie miſeries, what comfort, or conſolation shall moderate <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.</note> theſe great aduerſities? What remedie is to be expected in theſe <note place="margin">An obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cie tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> euills, that as on the one ſide we are terrified, and contriſtated at our future rebukes, ſoe we may be a little comforted with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the diuine mercie that followes them? Herevnto the Saincts propoſed vnto me this Parable. When a greene tree cutt downe from the ſtock, &amp; remooued three furlongs diſtant from his owne roote, shall without the helpe of anie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hand, or by anie externall ayde, returne againe to his owne roote, and placing it ſelf thereon, shall reſume iuice againe to florish, and bring forth fruit, then and not before ſome comfort may be hoped for, in this tribulation, and a remedie againſt the foretould aduerſitie may be expected. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſayd thus, they returned to heauen, and I to you, and my ſelf againe.</p>

This <hi>Stigand</hi> being there preſent at the kings narration, had all the powers of his ſoule ſoe barred vp againſt <note place="margin">Stigand a Clergie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for inuading a Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine Monks.</note> all goodnes, that he waxed more obdurate, at the dreadfull ſtorie, neyther was he terrified with the threatning oracle, nor gaue anie creditt to the pious relatour: but murmuring within him ſelf, that the king began to dote in his old age, he laughed where he had more cauſe to weepe. But the reſt, whoſe minds were more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly giuen, lamented and wept abundantly, knowing verie well that the Prelates and Princes led their liues according as the bleſſed king had declared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XXV.</label> SOME are of opinion, that the foreſayd ſimilitude is grounded vppon an impoſſibilitie; and theſe were chiefly ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed that the whole Nobilitie of the land was come to ſoe low anebbe, and ſoe farre ſpent, that there was neyther king, nor Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, nor Abbot, nor Prince of the ſame nation ſcarſe to be ſeene <note place="margin">An inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Kings vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> in <hi>England.</hi> But quite of an other opinion am I (ſaith <hi>Alured)</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that S. DVNSTAN did both foretell that this calamitie should befall vs, and yet afterwards promiſed a comfortable redreſſe. Thus then it may be expounded: This tree ſignified the kingdom of <hi>England</hi> in glorie beautifull, in delights and riches plentifull, and in the excellencie of the Royall dignitie moſt eminent. The roote from whence all this honour proceeded, was the Royall ſtemme, or race which from <hi>Alfred,</hi> (who was the firſt of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Kings annoynted, and conſecrated by the Pope) deſcended by a direct line of ſucceſſion to S. EDWARD. The tree was cutt off from the ſtock, when the kingdom being deuided from this royall iſſue, was tranſlated to an other linage: the diſtance of three fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs shewes that during the raigne of three Kings there should be noe mutuall participation betwixt the new and the auncient race of Kings: for <hi>Harold</hi> ſucceeded King EDWARD, next to him came in <hi>William Conquerour,</hi> and after him his ſonne <hi>William Rufus.</hi> But this Royall tree tooke roote againe, when <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt vnto whom all Regall dignitie was tranſported, neyther by force compelled, nor
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15374:35"/>
vrged with hope of gaine, but meerly taken with an affection of loue, tooke to wife <hi>Mawde</hi> daughter to S. EDWARDS neece, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and vniting togeather by this mariage the bloud royall of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> both in one. Then this tree did truely flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, when of this vnited royaltie, <hi>Mawde</hi> the Empreſſe was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: and then it brought forth fruit, when by her we had <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond who like vnto a corner ſtone vnited both nations togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therefore by this we now ſee, that <hi>England</hi> hath an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> King, as allſoe Bishops, Abbots, Princes, and knights of the ſame auncient race, deriued from this vnion of both nations. But if anie man be diſpleaſed with this expoſition, let him eyther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it better, or expect an other time vntill he find theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities fullfilled.</p>

of the <hi>English</hi> nation. He was borne in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> and in his youth followed the diſcipline of warre, in the Royall ſeruice of <hi>Oſwy</hi> king of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> from whoſe princely liberalitie he receaued, as the reward of his faithfull ſeruice, no ſmall poſſeſſion of lands &amp; <note place="margin">His life during his youth.</note> meanes ſuteable to his degree and calling. Theſe for a time he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed, till he attayned to the florishing age of twentie fiue yeares, and then (a diuine inſpiration mouing him therevnto) he forſoke &amp; left the world and fading worldly goods for loue of the eternall, he deſpiſed the warre fare of theſe lower regions &amp; the vaine rewards thereof, that ſeruing vnder the enſeigne of our true King CHRIST IESVS he might receaue an euerlaſting kingdom aboue; He left his countrey, houſe, and kinred for the loue of CHRIST and his Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that he might gaine the hundredfould reward he promiſeth, and poſſeſſe life euerlaſting: he refuſed to enter into worldly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage that in the court of heauen he might be worthie to follow the holy lambe ſoe candid with the glorie of virginitie; he loathed to be a carnall father of children, being ordayned by CHRIST to <note place="margin">His firſt iourney to Rome.</note> traine vp his children in the ſpirituall doctrine of heauen. Hauing left therefore his countrey (becauſe the Chriſtian faith, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall diſcipline was yet but rawly eſtablished in <hi>England)</hi> he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> there, as in the ſource and fountaine of all true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to learne a perfect forme oflife, where CHRISTS chief Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had planted the firſt and principall foundation and head of the whole Catholicke Church.

But he made no long ſtay at <hi>Rome,</hi> but returned back into <hi>England,</hi> where he was verie diligent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to honour, and as farre as he was able to practiſe him ſelf, and teach others thoſe rules of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline at home, which he had learnt, and ſeene abroade.</p>

BENNET, notwithſtanding the earneſt perſuaſions and entreaties of his father to ſtay at home. Their iourney ſucceeded well, and shortly after they returned in ſafetie againe, during the time of Pope <hi>Vitalian.</hi> When S. BENNET
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:15374:44"/>
came not emptie, but loaden with the ſweetnes of good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom doctrine as before; which the better to digeſt, after ſome <note place="margin">He taketh the habitt of S.

BENEDICT, and receaued the Eccleſiaſticall tonſure. In this pious ſchoole of regular diſcipline he liued for the ſpace of two yeares, very carefully learning, and obſeruing the rules of a true monaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and religious life. But noe ſooner was he a litle hardened in the ſurnace of religion, and made perfectly ſtrong and able to reſiſt the temptations and aduerſities of the world, but his loue to the Prince of the Apoſtles (which it ſeemes lay buried at <hi>Rome)</hi> ſerued as a loadſtone to draw him thither againe. And finding a fitt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of shipping he committed him ſelf to that much deſired iourney, which moſt proſperouſly he performed. It was at the time when <hi>Egbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi> (as we haue ſayd in the life of S. ADRIAN) had ſent <hi>Wighart</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> to be conſecrated Archbishop of <hi>Cantur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> But <hi>Wighart</hi> dieing, and <hi>Theodore</hi> being made Archbishop in his ſteede, S. BENNET, found to be a man very wiſe, religious, and induſtrious (allthough at that time otherwiſe determined) was by commaund of the Pope compelled to ceaſe from the deuotion of his pilgrimage to attend vnto imployments of a higher calling; which was to returne into <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Theodore</hi> now Elect of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbury,</hi> and S. ADRIAN Abbot, to ſerue them both for a guide and an interpreter by the way, and in <hi>England.</hi> BENNET, whoſe chiefeſt leſſon was obedience, moſt willingly yeelded to the Popes deſire, and brought the Archbishop into <hi>Kent,</hi> where they were both gratefully wellcome. <hi>Theodore</hi> a ſcended the ſeate of the Archbisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick, and S. BENNET vndertooke the gouernment of the monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of S. PETER and PAVL in <hi>Canturbury,</hi> of which afterwards S. ADRIAN was made Abbot. For S. BENNET hauing ruled there two <note place="margin">His third iourney to Rome.</note> yeares entred into his third iourney towards <hi>Rome,</hi> which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with his wonted proſperitie. And at his returne he brought with him not a few bookes fraught with diuine learning, all which he had eyther bought at an eaſie rate, or receaued gratis from his friends. Coming thus loaden into <hi>England,</hi> he betooke him ſelf to haue ſome conference with the King of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons</hi> called <hi>Kene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walk,</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:15374:44"/>
whoſe courteous friendship he had made vſe of before, &amp; bin much aſſiſted by his benefitts to him-wards. But this good King being about the ſame time taken away by an immature death, the holy man was fruſtrated of his deſire; and therefore he turned his iourney directly into his owne countrey, where he was borne, and went to <hi>Egfrid</hi> then King of the <hi>Northumbers.</hi> To whom he made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all whatſoeuer he had done ſince he departed a yonge man out of his countrey: neyther did he keepe ſecret from him how he was enflamed with a feruent deſire of religion: then he tould him whatſoeuer he had learned both in <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; other places touching Eccleſiaſticall and monaſticall order and diſcipline: and what ſtore of diuine bookes he had purchaſed, and with what great reliques of the Apoſtles, and Martyrs, he had enriched his countrey. At length the King liked him ſoe well, and preuayled ſoe farre with him, and gott ſoe great loue, and familiaritie, that he gaue him out of his reuenews the lands of three ſcore and tenne families, to build a monaſterie in honour of the Prince of the Apoſtles S. PETER, which S. BENNET with great ioy and ſpeed perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in the yeare of our Lord 674. the fourth yeare of King <hi>Egfrid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>III.</label> IN THE meane time before the foundation of the Church was layd S. BENNET went ouer into <hi>France,</hi> and brought thence maſons, &amp; other skillfull workemen to build it of ſtone, according to the <hi>Roman</hi> faſhion, which he euer loued. And the great loue he <note place="margin">The firſt vſe of gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in England.</note> bore to the Apoſtle S. PETER, in whoſe honour he laboured, made him vſe ſuch diligence, that within the compaſſe of a yeare after the foundation was layd, the ſolemnities of Maſſe were honorably celebrated therein. But when the worke drew neere vnto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, he likewiſe ſent meſſengers into <hi>France,</hi> to fetch ouer glaſiers, to adorne the windowes with glaſſe; a worke neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vſed in <hi>England.</hi> They came, and did not only perfect this worke, but allſoe taught their trade vnto manie of our English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Allſoe ſuch ſacred veſſels, veſtments, and other neceſſaries for the ſeruice of Church and Altar as could not be found in <hi>England,</hi> like a religious marchant, he prouided and bought from beyond the ſeas. But finding the pouertie and want of <hi>France</hi> not to be able to furnish him with ſuch ornaments as he deſired, and eſpecially to obtaine from the Pope new priuiledges for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:15374:45"/>
his new-built monaſterie, he made a fourth iourney to <hi>Rome;</hi> and this as ſoone as he had aſſembled a Conuent of Monkes into it, and <note place="margin">His fourth iourney to Rome.</note> ordered them according to the rule and inſtitution of great S. BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NEDICT. Shortly after he returned, making a more happie returne of ſpirituall Gods then euer he had done before. For beſides allmoſt an innumerable multitude of bookes, and great ſtore of reliques of the Apoſtles, and Martirs of CHRISTS Church, he had obtayned of Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> to haue <hi>Iohn</hi> chief Cantor of S. PETERS, and Abbot of S. MARTINS in <hi>Rome</hi> along with him into <hi>England,</hi> to inſtruct and teach as well his monaſterie, as other Churches allſoe in the forme and manner of ſinging, and doeing all other Eccleſiaſticall rites, and ceremonies, according to the inſtitution of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. All which <hi>Iohn</hi> at his coming he performed, not only by word of mouth, but allſoe by publishing manie rules, and precepts to that purpoſe in writing, which for memorie ſake were afterwards carefully layd vpp and reſerued in the librarie of the ſayd monaſterie. Allſoe by the licence of King <hi>Egfrid,</hi> and at his earneſt entreatie, he obtained of the ſame Pope letters of priuiledges graunted vnto the ſayd mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie, to warrant, defend, and free it from all externe iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or forcible inuaſions for euer. Likewiſe he brought from <hi>Rome</hi> many pictures of holy images, to beautifie, and adorne his Church, and namely a picture of the B. VIRGIN MARIE, and the <note place="margin">Pictures vſed in Catholick Churches</note> twelue Apoſtles, which he placed in the middle arche or vault of the Church from wall, to wall, and with pictures contayning all the Euangelicall hiſtory, he adorned the north ſide; and with others of the viſions of the Apocalypſe, he made the ſouth part correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vnto it: To the end that all that came into the Church, euen the vnlearned, which way ſoeuer they caſt their eyes, might behold and contemplate (though in an image) eyther the louing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of CHRIST, or his Saincts; or with a more watchfull mind conſider the wonderfull grace of his incarnation; or hauing before their eyes the danger of the laſt rigid examin, they might remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber more diſtrictly to examine the guilt of their owne conſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>IV.</label> NOW when King <hi>Egfrid</hi> ſaw with what great vertue, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie, <note place="margin">See the deuotion of this good king</note> and religion this venerable man did doe the part of a wiſe, and holy ſteward in all theſe proceedings, he was wonderfull much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted thereat, and bicauſe he perceaued the land he had giuen
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:15374:45"/>
him, to haue bin well and fruictfully giuen, he encreaſed his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer guift, with the donation of fortie families more. On which land by counſell, and perſwaſion of the King, the holy man built an <note place="margin">He buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth an other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery to S.

And as the bodie cannot liue without the head by which it breathes, nor the head without the bodie by which it liues: Soe let noe man anie way attempt to diſturbe or diſquiet theſe two mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the chief Apoſtles, that togeather are knitt in a fraternall ſocietie, of peace.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>V.</label> ABOVT this time, the bleſſed Sainct hauing much encreaſed the number of Monks in both theſe places, and ordered them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of his great Maſter S. BENEDICT, he made one <hi>Eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterwin</hi> a Prieſt and Monk, Abbot of the monaſtery of S PETER, to <note place="margin">Eoſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot.</note> the end that by the ſociable aſſiſtance of ſoe vertuous a Colleague, he might with more eaſe vndergoe the labour of gouernement, which he was ſcarſe able to performe alone, by reaſon of his much trauelling vp and downe for the good of his monaſterie, and his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent iourneys beyond ſeas, vncertaine when to returne. <hi>Eosterwin</hi> therefore vndertooke the care of the monaſterie the ninth yeare after the foundation; and remained in the ſame while he liued, and he liued but fower yeares after. He was a man by byrth noble, but he did not make vſe of the worth of his nobilitie (as manie doe) to breed matter of outward glorie, and contempt of others, but made it the firſt ſtepp to ennoble, and enrich his mind with vertue. For being cozen german vnto S. BENNET, they were both ſoe truely allied in a vertuous nobilitie oſ minds, both alike ſuch ſincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of all worldly reſpects and honours, that neyther the one coming into the monaſtery did expect to be preferred eyther by reaſon of his honourable nobilitie, or kinred, or the other iudge it a thing fitt to be offered him vppon thoſe reſpects: But being a manfull of good and holy intentions, only reioyced that he did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue regular diſcipline in all things, in an equall meaſure with the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:15374:46"/>
reſt of his brethren. But S. BENNET, ſoone after he had ordayned <hi>Eoſterwin</hi> Abbot of S. PETERS, and <hi>Ceolfrid</hi> of S. PAVLS, made his fift iourney out of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and happily returned home, enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched as before, with very memorable guifts of eccleſiaſticall wealth, <note place="margin">His fift iourney to Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me.</note> as bookes, reliques of Saincts, and pictures, contayning the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the ould, and new teſtament compared togeather, and ſuch like. And amongſt other things, he brought two cloakes all of ſilk, of an incomparable worke; for which he purchaſed of King <hi>Ald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frid,</hi> and his Councell (for <hi>Egfrid</hi> was ſlaine in his abſence) the land of three families, on the ſouth ſide of the riuer <hi>Were.</hi> But the ioyes he brought from abroade, where mingled with ſadnes at home; for he found <hi>Eoſterwin,</hi> whom at his departure he had left Abbot of S. PETERS Monaſterie, and not a few of his monaſticall flock, to haue changed this world for a better, being taken away by the peſtilent furie of a ſicknes, which raged all ouer the countrey. Yet to this there was comfort at hand, that by the election of the brethren, and his fellow-Abbot <hi>Ceolfrid,</hi> he found one <hi>Sigfrid</hi> a deacon of the ſame monaſterie, a very reuerend, and meeke man, ſubſtituted in <hi>Eosterwins</hi> place. This <hi>Sigfrid</hi> was a man very ſufficiently inſtructed in the knowledge of holy ſcriptures, adorned with moſt godly manners, endowed with a wonderfull vertue of abſtinence, and for the better conſeruing of the vertues of his mind, he was kept vnder with noe ſmall infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of bodie; and to maintaine the innocencie of his heart, he allwaies laboured with a hurtfulland irremediable diſeaſe of the lungs.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>VII.</label> FOR you ought not to imagine (ſayd he) that the lawes <note place="margin">His ſpeech to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren on his death bed.</note> and conſtitutions which I haue giuen you, haue proceeded out of my owneignorant, and vnlearned vnderſtanding; for out of ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen diuers monaſteries, which among all the weariſom labours of my often trauells, I found to be beſt, haue I learnt, and gathered. all theſe precepts, deliuered them to your pietie to be obſerued. But chiefly this precept he did often times reiterate vnto them, that in the election of their Abbot they should haue noe regard to the nobilitie of byrth, without the worthines of vertue; nor reſpect the greatnes of dignitie in the world, but the aboundance of charitie, and humilitie in religion: For in very deed I tell you (ſayd he) that in compariſon of two euills, I had rather ſee the place in which with ſoe great labours I haue built this monaſterie, reduced into a perpetuall deſert, (if ſoe it pleaſe God) then that my owne brother, who is knowne not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſtepps of vertue, should ſucceede me in title of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, to rule, and gouerne the ſame.

and approoued to be moſt worthy, and fitt to performe ſoe great an office: and ſuch an one being found, you shall preſent him to the Bishop, who with his wonted benediction ought to confirme him in the Abbatiall dignitie. In theſe and ſuch like ſpeeches did he ſpend a great part of his weake ſickly dayes; whilſt to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the weariſom teadiouſnes of the long night, which the heauy burden of his diſeaſe did render reſtleſſe from ſleepe, he would ſome times call one of his brethren to reade vnto him eyther the example of holy <hi>Iobs</hi> vnmatcheable patience, or ſome other part of the ſcripture, whereby he might receaue ſome comfort in his grief, and be able more liuely to lift vpp him ſelf from the loweſt degree of worldly torment, to the confideration of the higheſt reward of his ſuffering. And becauſe he could not by anie meanes riſe to pray, nor eaſily make vſe eyther of tongue, or voice, to recite his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed taske of pſalmes, he learnt by his owne prudence, and the <note place="margin">His truly religious ſpiritt.</note> dictamen of a true religious ſpirit and affection, to call certaine of the brethren vnto him at all the howers eyther of day, or night of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, with whom, being diuided into two quiers he would ſing, and ſay as well as he was able, all the accuſtomed pſalmes of the office, and what his weaknes would not let him performe, was by their aſſiſtance ſupplied.</p>

And in all his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he would not heare of a phiſitian, but contemning for the loue of God all remedies of the bodie, he only buſied him ſelf about that one thing which is neceſſarie, to prouide for the health of his ſoule.

               <p>FVRSEVS borne in <hi>Ireland</hi> of Royall parents, but more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled by his vertues then his birth, was famous for dignitie amongſt his friends, but excelling ouer the world in the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall guift of diuine grace. He was of a beautifull forme, chaſt of bodie, deuout in mind, affable in diſcourſe, of an amiable aſpect, and replenished with grace, and good workes: brought vp from his verie infancie in the continuall ſtudie of holy ſcripture, and mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall <note place="margin">His youth and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> diſcipline. And as he grew in yeares, ſoe grew he allſoe in the daily increaſe of vertue, and pious deſires. For the better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment whereof, he forſaked his parents, friends, and natiue ſoyle, and betooke him ſelf for the ſpace of ſome yeares to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of holy ſcriptures; in which in short time he became ſufficiently well inſtructed. But that the world might know that he did not only labour for him ſelf, but for all thoſe that ſought the truth, he built a monaſterie, which ſerued as a free-ſchoole of vertue, wherein he taught all that came vnto him the true way of ſaluation. Great was the number of people that flocked togeather vnto this holy teacher of vertue, by whoſe godly preaching, and deuout exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, manie were not only retired from their bad manner of life, and brought into the right way of ſaluation; but allſoe were ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vnto the regular obſeruance of a monaſticall order. Amongſt theſe, he was deſirous to haue the companie of ſome of his owne kinſinen, and for that end, he made a iourney vnto his natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: but in the way he happened to fall ſick, and in this ſicknes his ſoule, being as it were ſeparated from her earthly lodging, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed a moſt delightfull viſion of Angels, that ſeemed to lift him vp towards heauen, were he beheld an infinite companie of heauenly citizens, who with their ſweet melodie filled his rauished vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding with ineſtimable ioy and comfort.

But being reſtored to his bodie, and him ſelf againe, about the time that the cock giues warning of the dayes approach, he heard, in ſteed of the melodious harmonie of the Angels, the wofull lamentations, and cries of his friends and kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>follies, who all this time had watched at his bodie, which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be dead. But now perceauing him againe to come to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, their lamentation was changed into a fearefull admiration, and their admiration bred ioy to ſee him aliue. Then the holy man look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about him, and finding noe man, vnto whoſe wiſedom he could committ the knowledge of the viſion he had ſeene, was verie ſorrowfull; chooſing for that time, rather to burie it within the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of his owne heart, then reueale it vnto ſuch as knew not how to vnderſtand it.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>II.</label> BVT the third day afterwards being againe taken with the like rauiſhment, he beheld nor only greater ioyes of the bleſſed compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie <note place="margin">An other viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt ſtrange.</note> of heauen, but allſoe the wonderfull warres, which the wicked ſpirits rayſed againſt him, ſtriuing to hinder his iourney towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: allbeit the protection of the Angels fruſtrated their malicious endeauours. Manie falſe accuſations they brought againſt him, and layd diuers crimes to his chardge, of all which by his guides the Angels, he was freely diſengaged. And as he was lifted vp by theſe bleſſed ſpirits towards heauen, they commaunded him to looke downe into the world. Which done, he ſaw like a darke and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">The 4. fiers of vice that burne the world.</note> valley vnderneath him. And in the ayre he beheld fower fiers not farre diſtant one from the other: which they tould him were the fiers that ſhould burne and conſume the world. The firſt they ſayd was the fier of <hi>Liars:</hi> which thoſe fall into, that neglect to full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill their promiſe made in Baptiſme, in renouncing the deuill, and all his workes. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was the fier of <hi>Couetouſnes,</hi> appointed for ſuch as preferre the riches of the world before the loue of heauen, and heauenly things. The third was the fier of <hi>Diſcord,</hi> prouided for thoſe that ſticke not to offend their neighbours, euen in trifling and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous matters. The fourth was the fier of <hi>Jmpietie,</hi> allotted for
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:15374:57"/>
ſuch as care not how they ſpoile, and oppres;ſe the inferiour, and weaker ſorte of people. He beheld theſe fiers to encreaſe ſoe by little, and little till at length by ſpreading they came togeather and made one mightie huge and dreadfull flame, which ſeemed to approach neere vnto him. Whereat he cried out to his guide the Angel: O Lord, behold it cometh vppon me. <hi>Feare not</hi> (replied he) <hi>that which thou hast not kindled shall not burne thee.</hi> For allthough this ſeeme to be a mightie great and terrible fier, yet it only tries, and examines men according as their workes haue deſerued: the worldly deſires of men ſhall burne in theſe flames. For euen as one is enflamed in bodie by vnlawfull luſt, and pleaſure, ſoe releaſed from his bodie he ſhall ſuffer his deſerued torments in fier. Then he beheld one of the three Angels his guides, to walke before, and diuide the flames, and the other two conducting him on each ſide through the fier, defended him from the danger thereof. He ſaw likewiſe the deuils flieing through the flames, making fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie warres againſt the iuſt: then followed their manie accuſations againſt him, and the Angels defence in his behalf, with a viſion of a greater companie of heauenly ſpirits; as allſoe of manie men of his countrey and acquaintance, that he had knowne not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily to haue behaued them ſelues in the ſacred function of Prieſthood, of whom he learnt manie things verie profitable, as well for him ſelf, as for all ſuch as would heare them. When theſe had ended their diſcourſe, and returned vnto heauen with the troupes of Angels, there only remained with B. FVRSEVS the three Angels his guides; with whom returned againe towards the foreſayd fier, the Angel diuided the flame as before, but as the holy man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the way layd open for him, the wicked ſpirits caught vp one of thoſe wretched ſoules which they broyled in thoſe flames, and threw it at him; at the verie touch whereof, he found his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and cheeke to be ſcorched, and burnt. The holy man well kne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>w the perſon, and remembred that at his death he had giuen him a garment which he receaued. But the holy Angell taking the tormented ſoule caſt him againe into the fier: whereat the wicked ſpirit cried out: Why doe you caſt him of now, whom you receaued before. For as you tooke the goods of that ſinner, ſoe ought you to partake of his torments. Not out of couetouſnes (replied the Angel)
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:15374:57"/>
but to ſaue his ſoule did he receaue it: and therewith the fier ceaſed. And the Angel turning vnto the holy man, ſayd: <hi>that which thou di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt kindle, now hath burnt thee:</hi> for hadeſt not thou taken the goods of this man dieing in ſinne, the torment of his fier had not touched thee. And ſpeaking further, he taught him what was to be done for the ſaluation of thoſe that did repent.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>III.</label> BEING reſtored to him ſelf againe, he bore all his life time after a viſible ſigne of the burning which he had endured in his ſoule, vppon his ſhoulders, and cheeke, the Fleſh euidently ſhewing to the wonder of all beholders, what the ſoule had inwardly, and hiddenly ſuffered. But he retained allwaies his wonted care, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of following vertuous &amp; pious courſes, by word, worke, and example to teach, and preach the way of truth, and iuſtice vnto the world. Yet he would neuer manifeſt the order and manner of his viſions but vnto ſuch only, as out of a deſire of repentance, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction of hearth deſired to know them. There liueth yet (ſaith <note place="margin">Proofe of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> venerable BEDE) an auncient Monke of our monaſterie, who is wont to relate, that a certaine religious and truſtie man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tould him that he had both ſeene S. FVRSEVS in the prouince of the <hi>Eaſt-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,</hi> and heard the manner of theſe viſions out of his owne mouth. Adding moreouer, that in the middeſt of winter, when the froſt was moſt ſharp, &amp; cold, that ſitting in a light and ſingle garment recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe viſions, eyther out of the greatnes of the feare he concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or of the ſweetnes he receaued by the remembrance of them, he would ſweate as much as if it had bin the hotteſt day of ſommer.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>IV.</label> HAVING therefore a long time preached the word of God in <hi>Jreland</hi> his owne countrey, being not able anie longer eaſily to endure the great multitude of people that flocked vnto him, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke all that he ſeemed to enioy, &amp; goeing out of his natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, with ſome few of his brethren in his companie, he paſſed the ſeas, and came through <hi>Wales</hi> into the prouince of the <hi>English,</hi> where he was honourably receaued, and worthily entertained by <hi>Sigebert</hi> then King of the <hi>East-Angles.</hi> But he, that deſired where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he went allwaies to promote the ſeruice of allmightie God, beganne preſently to putt in practiſe his accuſtomed trade of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dhing, labouring by the example of his vertues, or the inciting forces of his ſpeeches, eyther to conuert the incredulous to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:15374:58"/>
the truth, or to ſtrengthn, and confirme the faithfull more and more in the truth, and loue of IESVS CHRIST. Such were his daily labours, ſuch were the pious employments in which he continually buſied all the powers of his ſoule, and forces of his body.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>V.</label> BVT while theſe things are thus doeing he fell againe into an other ſicknes, during which he enioyed the delightfull viſion of <note place="margin">An other viſion.</note> Angels, that admoniſhed him to proceed with courage, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the happily begunne worke of preaching, as allſo with an inuincible patience, to hold on his accuſtomed exerciſe of watching, faſting, and prayer: bicauſe that his death was certaine, but the hower of his death moſt vncertaine. With this viſion being much confirmed in his pious courſes, he haſtened to build a monaſterie on the land which King <hi>Sigebert</hi> had giuen him for that purpoſe: which done he inſtituted it with the regular diſcipline of a monaſticall life vnder the holy rule of of S. BENEDICT. The ſituation of this mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie by reaſon of the neerenes of the ſea, and words was verie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant: it being built in a certaine old caſtle called <hi>Cnobbersburg,</hi> that is the towne of of <hi>Cnobber:</hi> it was afterwards by <hi>Anna</hi> King of that prouince, and manie other noblemen, verie richly adorned with more ſtately edifices, and enriched with diuers guifts of great worth.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>VI.</label> And in this verie monaſterie King <hi>Sigebert</hi> him ſelf, being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <note place="margin">

But long he had not enioyed this quiet life, when wicked <hi>Penda</hi> King of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> making warre againſt his forſaken Kingdom, he was by force taken out of the monaſterie by his owne friends, and made Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of their armie, which they preſuppoſed would be much harte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and encouraged with his preſence: Who to ſhew that his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was dearer to him then his life, put on no other armour then a good conſcience, nor taking other weapon then a little rodd in <note place="margin">The can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of a ſecure conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> his hand, went ſecurely, though vnwillingly, againſt the bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſting armies of his and CHRISTS enemies, where both he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

               <p>
                  <label>VII.</label> BVT lets vs returne vnto S. FVRSEVS who now hauing, as we haue ſayd, built a monaſterie, and eſtabliſhed it with the rule and diſciple of a monaſticall order, being deſirous to free him ſelf not only from all worldly cares, but allſoe from the gouernment of his monaſterie, gaue vp the whole care thereof vnto his brother <hi>Fulla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> and being at libertie, he ſoe diſpoſed of him ſelf as meaning to ſpend and end the remainder of his life in an Anachoreticall or Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miticall life. He had an other brother called <hi>Vltanus,</hi> who out of the continuall probation of the monaſticall, and clauſtrall manner of liuing had betaken him ſelf to the ſolitarines of the deſert. Vnto him FVRSEVS went alone, and togeather with him, he liued by the labour of his hands for the ſpace of a whole yeare in continuall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and prayer, &amp; doeing of pennance. But perceauing the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to be much diſquieted by the frequent incurſions of Pagans, and foreſeeing the eminent danger of the monaſteries, leauing all things in good order he ſayled into <hi>Fraunce,</hi> where being honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entertained by the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Clouis</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Erconwald</hi> then Prouoſt of <hi>Peronne;</hi> he built a monaſterie in a place called <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniacum,</hi> into which were introduced the monkes of S. BENEDICTS order, for as yet and manie yeares after there was noe other rule on foote but his, in all the Occidentall Church. And not long after S. FVRSEVS falling ſick, he quickly felt the vehemencie of his diſeaſe to grow ſoe ſtrongly vppon him as he plainly perceaued his time to draw neere: therefore recommending him ſelf vnto God, and lifting vp his eyes towards heauen, he yeelded vp his pure ſoule into the hands of his Redeemer, the ſixteenth day of <hi>January. Erconwald</hi> cauſed his bodie to be referued in the Church Porch of <hi>Peronne,</hi> where it remained for the ſpace of twentie fix daies till the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the new-built Church in the ſame towne was finiſhed: at what time being taken vp it was found with no more ſigne of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption then if he had died but that verie hower.</p>

There this pretious and admirable iewell of God was firſt entertained by a famous Prince of the <hi>French</hi> by name <hi>Erchinoaldus,</hi> then chief ruler of the Kings Pallace: in whoſe ſeruice, being but yong, ſhe behaued her ſelf ſoe decently, that her <note place="margin">She ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Prince Erchino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ald.</note> vertuous conuerſation, and admirable condition, was verie pleaſing both to the Prince, and all his familie. For ſhe was of a generous mind, moſt chaſt in her behauiour, ſober, prudent, and friendly, plotting harme to none. In her ſpeech neyther light, nor preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, but guiding all her actions with the ſinceritie of a noble witt. The forme of her bodie was correſpondent to the nobilitie of her byrth, verle gratefull, and beautifull to all beholders; of a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance merrie, and conſtant, and in her gate graue. In a word, ſhe behaued her ſelf in all things ſoe well becoming her ſelf, that ſhe pleaſed the Prince <hi>Erchinoald</hi> infinitely, and gott great fauour in his ſight; in ſoe much that he appointed her to waite at his elbow, where often times ſhe playd the part of an honeſt cuppbearer, carefully fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wine vnto him.

But in all theſe honours euer ruling her ſelf by the raines of wiſedome, <note place="margin">Her won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull works of mercie.</note> with a watchfull care ſhe obeyed the King as her Lord, carying her ſelf to the Princes as a mother, to Prieſts as a daughter, &amp; to yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings as a pious nurſe: ſhe was louing vnto all, honouring Prieſts as her fathers, fauouring Monkes as her brethren, cheriſhing the poore as her domeſticks, and (remembring her owne eſtate of pilgrimage) ſhe entertained pilgrims as her owne children. She was a perpetuall refuge vnto widdowes, orphanes, and fatherleſſe children, and gaue ſuccour vnto all that were weake, and in want. She would alwaies exhort yong men to pietie, and religion; and often put the King in mind to haue a care of the Churches, and poore.

Her father being much ſued vnto on all ſides, and not knowing how to ridd him ſelf of thoſe impatient wooers, nor anſweare their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, motioned the matter to his daughter, giuing her free leaue to make choiſe of a husband according to her owne liking, amongſt that ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of ſutors.

Our Lord heard her prayer, and graunted her requeſt, by the loſſe of one of her fayre eyes, which burſt and dropt out of her head like a diſſolued pearle: and by this meanes ſhe became ſoe defformed, that noe man ſought after her anie more; when ſhe gott her fathers conſent to haſten her entrance into a monaſterie of religious woemen, which was the only heigth and ayme of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires.

The mayd hauing heard theſe words, ſpoken with a long and intelligible voice, and ſeeing not the authour, was much amazed, vntill (being willed by S.

Then the Prince acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the ſtrength of the mightie hand of God to hould him, did penance for his raſhnes, and at the prayer of the Sainct both he and and his followers were ſett at libertie, and his daughter perſeuered in the perfourmance of her ſacred vow.</p>

For in feature of bodie he was ſomething rude and vnhandſom.

In the meane time, his father, who was Lord of the two Churches <hi>Sempringham,</hi> and <hi>Tyrington,</hi> being much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the vertuous life of his ſonne, beſtowed both thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices vppon him.

In the meane time a great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of men, and woemen flocked togeather, to embrace this new inſtitution. When he out of his great humilitie of mind, indging him ſelf vnworthie to gouerne ſuch a pious companie, made a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the Abbey of <hi>Ciſterce</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where Pope <hi>Engenius</hi> at that <note place="margin">He goeth into Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.</note> time ſeiourned, that by his ſupreme authoritie, he might gett the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſome of the <hi>Ciſtercian</hi> monkes to vndertake the chardge, &amp; care of his new ofspring. The Pope hauing made a curious, and exact inquirie of him, and his manner of life, and vnderſtanding that Allmightie God had ennobled him, with manie admirable workes, was much grieued, that he had no ſooner notice, &amp; acquai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Manie other particular ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuts, according to his owne liking, he collected out of the ordinances of other monaſteries, all which he exactly ſett downe in writing; which afterwards were eſtabliſhed, and confirmed by the autoritie of Pope <hi>Engenius,</hi> and others.

One pious cuſtom he euer obſerued, which was to haue a certaine veſſell, or platter ſett on the table in time of dinner, which he called IESVS DISH, into which, not only the reliques, but ſome <note place="margin">A pious cuſtom.</note> principal partes of all the meate, were to be reſerued for the poore. He neuer vſed anie ſiluer, or gould plate on his table, but had it decked only with wodden, or earthen diſhes, and ſpoones of horne; and often times ſitting thereat, he would ſeaſon his meate with his owne teares, which he ſhed for his ſinnes, and thinking of the vanitie of the world and worldlings. He allwaies wore a hayre ſhirt next vnto his skinne, which very carefully he concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from others knowledge.

but tooke a ſmall allowance of ſleepe not in anie bed but ſitting in a chayre, that he might be the readier at his awake to fall to his prayer, and meditations. Hauing gouerned his troupe a long <note place="margin">He taketh a religious habitt.</note> time, him ſelf remayning in his ſecular apparell, and not obliged by anie vow vnto that profeſſion of a monaſticall life, which he preſcribed vnto others; leſt perchaunce his ſucceſſours might take example thereby, he wholely ſubmitted him ſelf vnder the obedience of one <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Sempringham</hi> a Canon of the Church of <hi>Malton,</hi> and receaued the religious habitt, and diſcipline, which he had taught, and eſtabliſhed; being now become of a maſter a ſcholler, euer honouring the ſayd <hi>Roger</hi> (who afterwards ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him) as his Tutor and teacher, during the whole remnant of his life.</p>

For with ſuch an exact and ſeuere an obſeruance of abſtinence, faſting, and watching he mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified his bodie vppon earth, that the skinne only ſticking vnto

the bones, he appeared vnto the behoulders as the true picture not of a carnall, but of a ſpirituall man, in a humaine ſhape. His daintieſt <note place="margin">His poore diet, and cloathing.</note> meate was oaten bread and a kind of gruell, or pottage made of oatmeale. He neuer dranke wine or anie other drinkes which cauſe dronkennes, but only on principall feaſtes, and then he would taſt a little, more for the ſolemnitie of the feaſt, then anie contentment of bodie. In watching he was ſoe diligent, and vnwearied, that he paſſed manie nights without anie ſleepe, nether would he euer giue himſelf to anie reſt but when extreme neceſſitie, and weaknes of nature co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him: and then not in bed, but leaning his head to a wall, he tooke a ſhort allowance of ſleepe, out of which preſently rowſing him ſelf, he would much blame, &amp; chaſtiſe his bodie, as yielding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ouermuch niceneſſe. His pillow (yf that may be called ſo) which he vſed to putt vnder his head was made of rowles, or ropes of hay wound vp together. He was content with poore ſimple cloathing, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned next to the skinne with a rude ſhirt of hayre-cloath. Till after a while, being growne from a freſhman to be an old beaten ſouldier of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> inſteed of his hayre-cloath, he wore next vnto his skinne, an iron coate of maile, which his old lord, and maſter, vnderſtanding his deſire thereof, had ſent vnto him, conſecrating that warlick armour <note place="margin">His morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of bodie.</note> to the warrefarre of heauen. To theſe his dayly auſterities, he added others by night, farre exceeding them in rigour, for in the ſharpeſt cold of winter, he was wont, hauing firſt putt of his iron coate, to entier naked into a veſſell of cold mater, where he would remayne reciting pſalmes &amp; himnes in prayſe of allmightie God, vntill he had throughly mortified and que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ched thoſe diſhoneſt fiers, &amp; importune motions of the fleſh, which verie furiouſly and often aſſayling his mind, ſought the ruine of his chaſtitie: but his breaſt was a firme rock of pure marble that vtterly denied entertaynment to anie ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes. And in all this rigour ſoe vnmercifully exerciſed vppon him ſelf, both in diſcourſe and behauiour, he was euer humble, and pleaſant vnto all others, and allthough he ſeldom or neuer ſpake to anie man, but vnſeene, and with his window ſhutt, yet his ſweete ſpeeches yeelded the ſound of a kind of heauenly harmonie to the eares of his hearers. <note place="margin">The fame of his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For his coate of maile hanging downe ſomwhat below his knees, with the rudenes thereof hindered him to kneele at ſuch times and ſoe often as he deſired: whereof hauing admoniſhed the knight his old maſter, who was only priuie to this ſecret, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his counſell therein. The knight would haue perſuaded him to ſend it to <hi>London</hi> to be cutt according to his deſire: But he being impatient of ſuch delay, and fearing thereby to lay open a gate to vaine gloire gaue him a payre of ſheares, and bad him in the name of God diſpatch that worke with his owne hands. The knight ſtaggering in his obedience, and iudging it to be dotage in the holy man that ſett him on a taske (as he thought) quite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, knew not what to ſay. Be conſtant (replied VLFRICK) and feare nothing, behold I goe to recommend this buſines vnto God, in the meane time endeauour confidently to finiſh this worke. The one falls to his prayers, the other endeauours with iron and ſteele to cutt iron, and ſteele: when both their labours tooke proſperous effect, to the admiration of the one, &amp; great ioy of the other. For the knight <note place="margin">Note a ſtrainge miracle.</note> in his cutting worke ſeemed rather to diuide a peece of cloath, then a peece of iro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with ſoe great facilitie the ſheares ranne through that ſteelie garment. But the holy man riſing from his prayers before the worke was finiſhed, the knight was forced to hould his hands; when VLFRICK coming to the window where he laboured, &amp; asking how he had ſucceeded in his buſines; Well, and proſperouſly (ſayd he) hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to, but now at thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, the ſheeres turne edge, &amp; are at a ſtay.

Then reſuming his former co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, with the like facilitie he went through the reſt. And from that time, the holy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſtrength of his owne fayth, without anie ſhee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, pulled aſunder the little rings of that part of his coate cutt off, &amp; diſtributed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> charitably to all that deſired, by vertue whereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie <note place="margin">The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of his coate cure manie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes.</note> diſeaſes were cured, according as it is recorded of the chaines of the holie Apoſtles, PETER, and PAVL and manie other Martirs.

An other time the holy man being ſick, his ordinarie enemie entred into the roome where he lay, and caſting a terrible looke vppon him, with a ſtaffe he had in his hand gaue him three great blowes on the head, and departed.

He, being as yet incredulous, receaued CHRIST in his legats, commended the meſſengers of eternall happines whom yet he miſtruſted, harboured thoſe ſtrange gueſts in his eittie of <hi>Doner,</hi> whom he knew not, and at firſt gaue them a dwelling with neceſſarie ſuſtenance for a time which afterwards he confirmed for euer vnto them, whoſe profeſſion of fayth and religion he did not yet admitt off. He did not abhorre the ſtrangenes of their habitt, nor manners, he did not repell them as ſtraingers, nor contemne them as humble, and deiected perſons, nor condemne them as men that vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the follie of his gods, and auncient lawes, but out of the ſweet meekenes of a royall mind, fauoured their ſacred la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and with a clement patience, ſuffered them to conuert whom they could to their fayth, ſhewing himſelf allwayes courteous to Chriſtians, being yet but a Heathen. Till at length hauing himſelf receaued the Chriſtian fayth, and waſhed away the filth of Idolatrie in the ſacred font of baptiſme, he confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with his royall authoritie whatſoeuer S.

He allſoe encouraged other Princes, who were ether his ſubiects, or colleagues, with all curteſie and mildnes to the fayth of CHRIST, heartyly louing all true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers as his brethren, kinſmen, and fellow-citezins of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heauen; ſoe that in a ſhort time, his holy endeauours too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke ſoe good effect, that the honour, and worſhip of the true God floriſhed ouer all his Kingdom, manie Churches were erected, the temples, and aultars of Idolls were deſtroyed, or conſecrated for the vſe of diuine ſeruice.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>II.</label> IN THE meane time the holy Pope S. GREGORIE, with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:15374:111"/>
affection did congratulate this good Kings pietie, encouraging him with the ſweete lines of his Epiſtles, as ſoe manie heauenly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations, to proceede in his Chriſtian zeale, inciting him to embrace true pietie and vertue, and ſtirring him vp, by the example of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, to aſpire to the vnſpeakeable reward of thoſe who ſtriue to enlarge, and amplifie the Kingdom of IESVS CHRIST. Mooued herewith, and the labour of S. AVGVSTIN, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of his owne pietie inclining him therevnto, he built a goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly Church in <hi>Canturbury,</hi> in honour of our Sauiour, commonly called <hi>Chriſt Church,</hi> and without the walles of the ſame towne, he <note place="margin">He buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> erected a monaſtery in honour of S.

S. PAVLS Church in <hi>London</hi> was allſoe the worke of this worthie King, where MELLITVS a <hi>Benedictin</hi> monk was firſt Bishop. He allſoe founded the Cathedrall Church of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and dedicated it to the honour of S. ANDREW the Apoſtle. He is likewiſe reported by antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to haue been the Authour of the monaſterie of <hi>Elie</hi> for <hi>Benedictin</hi> Nunnes, allbeit S. ETHELDRED a nunne of the ſame order, did ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie it afterwards, and reſtore it after long deſolation to the former ſtate, and glorie. All theſe monaſteries, Churches, and biſhops ſeas this pious king not only built, but enriched with manie large poſſeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of lands, guifts, and ornaments; omitting nothing which did anie way tend to the propagation, &amp; aduanoement of true Chriſtian religion.</p>

A moſt glorious ſight it was to ſee, or rather to admire him that held a ſceptre ouer ſoe large a dominion carefully to ſerue the poore; to behould him that terrified Kings, and Princes of the earth to feare the humble Prieſts of CHRIST IESVS, and to ſee the ruler of the poeple
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:15374:112"/>
to obey the clergie and reuerence the leſt, and loweſt, members of his holie flock. In ſumme, in repreſſing of vice, aduancing of vertue, fulfilling the commaundments of God, and in exerciſing all manner of workes of pietie and deuotion, he excelled beyond the power of weake words to expreſſe. At length when he had raygned ouer his poeple in all ſainctitie of life the ſpace of one and twentie yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his conuerſion, he left his temporall Kingdom, and gaue vp his bleſſed ſoule to enioy the neuer dyeing happines of the Kingdom of heauen; the foure and twentith day of <hi>February</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 616. All antiquitie, and the authoritie of auncient Saincts, are vnreſiſtable witneſſes of his holie life, for from the time of his death he was numbred in the Catologue of Saincts, and his feſtiuitie was honorably celebrated in the <hi>English</hi> Church.

He admiring how ſhe had paſſed through the furie of the mad doggs about his houſe, ſoe quietly without hurt, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned her with great ioy, and reuerence; and brought her (as ſhe deſired) into the chamber, where at that time, his daughter lay lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of a cruell diſeaſe, expecting euerie inſtant when her ſoule would yeeld vp her houſe of clay, to take her laſt iourney, when her dolefull parents, deſpayring of her rerouerie, with teares, and ſighs had allreadie prepared for her funerall rites. But the diuine goodnes of him that kills, and reuiues, ſtrikes, and heales againe, <note place="margin">A ſick woeman cured by her prayers.</note> through the prayers, &amp; interceſſions which the holy Virgin S.

And immediatly after her departure, her dead bodie appeared to manie of the ſtanders by in forme of a creature allreadie glorified, and a wonderfull ſweet and fragrant odour iſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from that holy veſſell of chaſtity, and filled the whole houſe. Moreouer, when her bodie was carried into the Church, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly light which obeyed her in her life, ſerued her likewiſe after her death, and lighted all the candles in the ſame Church without anie humane helpe, to the glorie of this holy Virgin, and great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and comfort of the beholders. She was buried in the ſame monaſterie where ſhe had liued, neere vnto her brother S. WINE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BALD, by the hands of her other brother S. WILLIBALD Biſhop, that the ſame earth might contayne them, whom the like loue of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, vertue, and pietie, truely made to be brother, and ſiſter. V. HER bodie was afterwards honourably tranſlated to the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictin</hi> monaſtery at <hi>Eiſtadt.</hi> And in the yeare 893. her ſacred tombe being againe opened her holy aſhes ſeemed all bedewed with water, which might be preſſed out dropp by dropp, and yet not one mite of the duſt would ſtick to their hands that touched it. At this time a great part of her holy reliques, was tranſlated to the monaſterie of <hi>Benedictine</hi> nunnes at <hi>Monheim</hi> in <hi>Germanie;</hi> And at both theſe places, manie rare miracles haue been wrought by the merits of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Virgin, which for breuitie we omitt.

Vnder this ſoe excellent a maſter, our worthie ſcholler became ſoe good a proficient in all profane, and diuine learning, that he was promoted to a Canonrie in the Church of <hi>Winchester.</hi> Where, when others, not regarding the inſtitute of their order, and calling, let looſe the raines to the lewd deſires of their minds, he conſtantly confined him ſelf to the preſcript rule of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall life. Soe that within a ſhort ſpace of time he was choſen Deane, in which office, all though as yet he were but yong, yet he zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly endeauoured to correct the corrupt manners of the auncient, and to reforme their youthfull mindes to the exerciſe of a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall rule and diſcipline. But they, growne old in their bad cuſtoms <note place="margin">See how hurtfull a bad cuſtom is.</note> would by noe meanes be recalled to the obedience of anie good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

For he was a man of great mortification, of a little ſleepe, ſparing in his diet, wiſe and moderate in his ſpeeches, and continuall in his prayers. But how rarely he was indued with patience, humilitie, curreſie, humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, meekenes and other vertues we may eaſily gueſſe out of the ſincerity of his burning charitie, wherein, it is beyond the force of

It happened one day that as the holy man being paſt the ghoſpell, lifted vp his eyes to heauen in his prayers, his ſeruant ſaw a perſon of a verie reuerend countenance houlding with great reuerence a little peece of white bread in his hands, lifted ouer his head. The poore man allthough wonderfully terrified with this viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet he ſtood ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fely to it, and would not offer to runne away. But perceauing the

ſame bread to encreaſe more and more, as the Prieſt went forward in his maſſe, and at length to become of an vnaccuſtomed bignes, he durſt ſtay noe longer, but fled out of the Church with all the haſt he could. Therefore S. OSWALD the Prieſt remayned alone, with the Angel on his right hand, that ſeemed to aſſiſt him. In the meane time, the poore man would euer now and then trembling peepe in at the Church doore, to hearken, and eſpie what was done about the aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: and when the ſeruanr of God, as the manner is, pronounced; <hi>Per omnia ſaecula ſaeeuloru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> &amp; other ſuch like, he heard the Angel anſweare him diſtinctly to euery thing, and ſaw him verie officiouſly wayting vppon him. Maſſe being ended his fugitiue ſeruant returned, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing the Angel to be gone, he ranne quaking to S. OSWALD, and related the cauſe of his running away, inquiring of him yf he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had ſeene the Angel. Truely (ſayd he) I both ſaw, and heard what thou doeſt rehearſe: all mightie Gods name be for euer bleſſed, who did not forſake me, being deſtitute of helpe in his holie ſacrifice. And I ſtrictly commaund thee, neuer to reueale this viſion while I liue.</p>

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:15374:139"/>

Soe that their father, though euer rebellious againſt allmightie God <note place="margin">Kyneburg marieth King Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred.</note> yet in them he furniſhed his heuenly Kingdom with two moſt ſacred branches of ſainctitie.

The poore, needie, and afflicted had ſoe pious a mother of her, that ſhe ſeemed to be borne for noe other end, then to relieue their miſerie. And yet did ſhe not ſoe excell in this one grace, as yf ſhe were dead to all other vertues, for there was allmoſt noe prayſe due vnto a pious-noble woeman, wherein ſhe might not iuſtly challege her part, all waies performing with a ſingular care, and diligence whatſoeuer appertayned vnto God, and his diuine <note place="margin">Her deſire of a chaſt life.</note> ſeruice. The feruour of her pietie dayly encreaſing, ſhe became at length ſoe rauiſhed with the ſacred loue of her immortall ſpouſe, the King of heauen, that ſhe earneſtly deſired to renounce her terrene King, &amp; Kingdom, thereby to beare the ſweet yoke of CHRIST with more freedom: and loathing all mortall embracements, ſhe aſpired only to vnite her ſoule with allmightie God, in the ſacred linkes of his diuine loue. Which, that with more libertie, and profitt, ſhe might bring to paſſe, ſhe neuer ceaſed with her pious perſwaſions to ſollicite the King her husband, vntill he had graunted her licence to liue according to her owne free will.

                     <label>II.</label> IN the very time of his youth (when that age is wont to enter <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation of his youth.</note> into the dangerous pathes of the world) he began to ſettle him ſelf in deuotion towards God, and with all the deſires of his heart, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to the countrey of euerlaſting life. But while he defferred the grace of his conuerſion ſomewhat long, and thought beſt after he was inſpired with that heauenly deſire, to hide it vnder his ſecular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, and to ſerue the world, as it were, in outward ſhew, ſoe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie difficulties out of that little care of the world aroſe againſt him, that now he was not detayned therein only in outward ſhew, but allmoſt in mind too, as he him ſelf affirmeth. Till as length the death <note place="margin">He buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.</note> of his parents giuing him free ſcope to diſpoſe of him ſelf and his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, he made that openly knowne, which before lay hid vnder the ſecrecie of his mind: &amp; that which before was only in the ſight of him that ſees all things, he manifeſted now to the publick view of the world. For diſtributing all his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall goods in pious workes, to the end that in the ſtate of pouertic he might follow CHRIST, who for our ſakes became poore, he built ſix monaſteries in <hi>Sicilie,</hi> &amp; furniſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:15374:145"/>
with vertuous Monkes to ſing the prayſes of allmightie God. The ſeauenth he erected within the walles of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which afterwards, hauing gathered togeather a great Conuent of Monks, &amp; forſakesn the Pompe of the world, he him ſelf liued in regular diſcipline vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the commaund, and obedience of an Abbot. Vnto theſe mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries he allotted ſoe much yearly rent out of his owne meanes, as might ſuffice each one for neceſſarie maintenance. All the reſt of his temporall goods, howſes, and lands, he ſhould, and dealed the money to the Poore, turning hereby (by a diuine inſpiration) all that glory, and nobilitie which he ſeemed to haue in the world, to purchaſe the happines of the euer-floriſhing cittie of heauen. And he that before was wont to walde through the cittie of <hi>Rome</hi> cloathed in ſilkes, and loaden with glittering gemmes, afterwards couered with a poore ſimple weede, became a poore ſeruant to the poore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>III.</label> FOR hauing changed his ſecular apparell, he went to the <note place="margin">He taketh the habit of a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictin. Monke.</note> monaſterie, and made a naked eſcape out of the ſhipwrack of the world. There he began to liue in ſoe great grace of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that euen then in his very beginning, he might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckoned in the number of the perfect. Soe that within a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, being choſen by the common conſent of the Conuent, he refuſed not to vndertake the charge of Abbott. To be ſhort, he was ſoe abſtinent in his diet, ſoe vigilant in his prayers, and ſoe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in his labour of faſting, that out of ouer much weaknes in his ſtomacke, he was ſearſe able to ſubſiſt. He ſuſteyned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a continuall ſicknes of bodie, and chiefly he was grieued with the trouble of that diſeaſe, which the phiſtians call <hi>Synco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi> in Greeke; the crueltie whereof ſoe tormented his vitall parts, that being taken with frequent, and ſudden agonies, he ſeemed euery moment to be readie to yeeld vp the ghoſt. But what manner of man he was in his monaſterie, and with how commendable an exerciſe he led his life, we may gather out of his owne words, which with weeping teares he vttered, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was Pope, <note place="margin">His ſpeech to Peter Deacon.</note> to <hi>Peter</hi> his Deacon, ſaying: <hi>My wretched minde being stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cken with the wound of its owne preſent neceſſarie imployment, remembers in what ſtate it was in the monasterie, how all ſleeting things then</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">See the happines of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious life</note> 
                     <hi>were ſubiect vnto it, how eminent it was aboue things that were toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the world; that it was accoustumed to thinke on nothing
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:15374:146"/>
but heauenly matters, that being yet detayned within this body, in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſurpaſſed that inortall priſon it ſelf. Yea and that (which is a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment allmoſt to all men) it was in loue euen with death it ſelf, as being the entrance to life, and the reward of labour. But now by reaſon of this heauie paſtorall charge, it ſuffers, in the affayres of ſecular men, and after ſoe ſwcet a ſorme of its owne quietnes, it is defiled with the duſt of worldly buſines. I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore what J doe endure, J conſider what J haue lost: and when J be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould that which J haue loſt, the burden which I undergoe growes more gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious. For now, behould Iam toſſed in the waues of a huge ſea, and in the ship of my mind, I am dasht, and beaten with the stormes of a mightie tempeſt: and whilest J call to my remembrance the tranquillitie of my former life, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtling back my eyes to what is past, J ſigh at the ſight of the deſired shore. And which is yet more irksome, whilſt I am diſcontentedly toſſed in theſe huge waues, I haue ſcarſe the happines to ſee the hauen which I left.</hi> Thus he was wont to relate of him ſelf, not bragging of his proficiencie in vertues, but rather bewayling his deficiencie; which he euer feared, to runne into, through his paſtorall charge. But allbeit he ſpake in this manner of him ſelf, out of a mind full of profound humilitie; it becommeth vs notwithſtanding to beleeue, that by reaſon of his paſtorall dignitie, he loſt nothing of his monaſticall perfection; Yea rather that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued thereby a greater aduancement in perfection, by his labour in the conuerſion of manie, then he had in times paſt in the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie of his owne priuate contemplation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>IV.</label> But by what meanes this bleſſed man was rayſed firſt to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Deacon, and after to the high dignitie of Chief Biſhop, the enſuing ſpeech ſhall declare. The <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop who then gouerned the Church, preceauing GREGORIE to clime vp by the degrees of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue <note place="margin">He is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the Po pes Legate.</note> to the height of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing called him out of his beloued mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie, herayſed the office, &amp; dignitie of Eccleſiaſticall orders, made him the ſeauenth Leuite, or Deacon for his aſſiſtance: and not long after directed him as his legate, or Commiſſarie to the cittie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for anſweares touching affayres of the Catholicque Church. Nether Yet did GREGORY allbeit he were conuerſant in a worldly pallace, intermitt the purpoſe of his heauenly manner of life. For the diuine prouidence ſoe ordayned, for his greater good, that diuers of the Monkes, out of an obligation of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall loue, followed him from the monaſterie, to the end that by
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:15374:146"/>
their example, as a ſhippe with Anchor, he might be ſtayed at the pleaſing ſhoare of prayer, and contemplation; and that, whileſt he was toſſed with the continuall blowes of ſecular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, he might flie to their companie, as to the boſone of a moſt ſure hauen, after the volumes, and waues, of his worldly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. And allthought that office, with the ſword of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne labours, now being abſtracted from his monaſterie, deſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him of his former tranquillitie of life, notwithſtanding among them, the aſpiration of his dayly remorſe, through the diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of their earneſt reading, did giue him new courage of life. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the companie of theſe, he was not only fenced from worldly aſſaults, but allſoe enkindled more, and more to the exerciſes of a heauenly life. Then, at the earneſt requeſt of thoſe his brethren, and chiefly of that Venerable man LEANDER Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <note place="margin">He writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls vppon Iob.</note> of <hi>Siuill</hi> (who at that time was come legate to <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the cauſe of the <hi>Viſigothes</hi> he was compelled to explicate the booke of holy <hi>Iob,</hi> ſoe intricate in miſteries. Nether had he the power to denie a worke, which at the requeſt of charitie, brotherly loue did impoſe vppon him, for the profitt of manie: but in a courſe of thirtie fiue bookes, he throughly inſtructed vs, how the ſame booke of <hi>Iob</hi> is to be vnderſtood litterally, how to be applied to the hidden miſteries of CHRIST and his Church, and in what ſenſe it may be fitted to euery Chriſtian in particular: In which worke of his, he diſcourſeth after ſuch an admirable manner of vertues, and vices, that he ſeemeth not only to expreſſe thoſe things in naked words only, but after a manner to demonſtrate them in viſible formes. Wherefore, there is noe doubt, but he had truly attayned to the perfection of the vertues them ſelues, whoſe effects with ſoe much efficacie he was able to declare.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <label>VI.</label> THEN, within a ſhort time, after the venerable Leuite or Deacon GREGORY was returned back to <hi>Rome,</hi> the riuer <hi>Tiber</hi> ſwelled ouer his bankes with ſoe great an inundation, and grew ſoe power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that his raging waters flowed ouer the walles of the cittie, and tooke violent poſſeſſion of manie ſtreets therein, in ſoe much that it ouerwhelmed manie monuments of auncient building. And with the outrage of this floud, the barnes of the Church were ouertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in which manie thouſand buſhels of wheat was loſt. Then a multitude of Serpents, with a monſtrous Dragon floted downe the gulph of this riuer, like vnto a mightie beame of timber, into the ſea: and manie beaſts were drowned, and caſt on ſhoare by the brinie waues of the troubled waters.

And endeauouring more waryly to auoyd the height of that dignitie, he often proclaimed him ſelf vnworthie of ſuch honour, fearing indeed, leſt the glorie of the world, which he had caſt off before, might by ſome meanes ſteale vppon him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, vnder the colour of Eccleſiaſticall gouernment. Whence
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:15374:147"/>
it came to paſſe that he directed an Epiſtle to <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour (vnto whoſe ſonne he was Godfather) entreating, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuring him, with manie prayers, neuer to graunt conſent to the poeple, to aduance him to the grace of ſoe great a dignitie.

                  <p>
                     <label>VII.</label> AND THE time of his conſecration being at hand, when that peſtilent diſeaſe ſtill made great hauock amongſt the poeple, he <note place="margin">His ſpeech to the Poeple.</note> began to exhort them to doe works of peanance in this ſort. It behooueth (moſt beloued brethren) at leaſt that we feare the ſcourges of God, now come and made preſent among vs by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which we ought to haue feared comming. Let grief open vs the gate of our conuerſion, and let that verie puniſhment which wee feele, diſſolue the hardnes of our hearts.

Nether doth ſicknes preuent death, but death it ſelf (as you ſee) preuents the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes of ſicknes: euery one that is ſtrucken, is ſuddenly taken away, before he can be conuerted to teares of peanance. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider therefore, Brethren, what manner of man he appeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fight of the dreadfull iudge, who had noe leaſure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle what he hath done.

to our Lord;</hi> for to lift vp our hears with our hands, is to rayſe and ſtirre vp the endeauour of our prayers, with the merit of good workes. He giueth, in very deed, he giueth great confidence to our feare, who crieth out by the Prophet, <hi>I will not the death of a ſinner, but</hi>

The ſword then of ſoe ſeuere a puniſhment hanging ouer our heads, let vs earneſtly labour with importune lamentations; for that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie which to men is wont to be gratefull, is pleaſing to the Iudge of truth; becauſe our pious, and mercifull Lord, who will not be angry, according as we deſerue, will haue things exacted from him by prayers.

For this cauſe (moſt deare brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) hauing our hearts contrite, and our workes amended, from wendſday morning next, let vs come in a deuout manner with teares, to the Litanies for ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> daies ſpace that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſeuere iudge meaneth to punish vs, and our offences, he may mitigate the ſentence of damnation, and ſpare vs.</hi> We thought fitt to ſett downe here this exhortation of S.

Therefore when a great multitude of Prieſts, Monkes, and others of all ages, ſexes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions were gathered togeather, at the day appointed, according to the holy mans commaund, to call to God for mercie; the ſiknes waxed ſoe cruell and outrageous among them, that within the ſpace of owne hower, whilſt the poeple made their ſupplications to our Lord, fowerſcore perſons fell to the ground and died.

when as he did yet ſeeke meanes to conceale him ſelf by flight; for the preuenting of his deſires, watch, and ward was appointed at all the gates of the cittie, vntill (as ſoe ſacred an order required) all the diuine rites, and ceremonies might duely and gloriouſly be accompliſhed towards him.

Whereby the Bleſſed man vnderſtood, that miſchief to be wrought by them: and being brought before him, they betraved the whole courſe of the Matter: For euer (anſweared the holy Pope) you muſt remayme in your blindnes, left ſeeing make you attempt your former wickednes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:15374:155"/>
with ſoe great a light of ſcience, that not onely theſe preſent times, but nether could the time past euer shew his equall. For ſoe highly he excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the perfection of all deſerts, that ſetting aſide all compariſons of famous men, antiquitie can shew vs nothing to paralell him: For he ouercame</hi> ANTHONIE <hi>in ſainctity,</hi> CIPRIAN <hi>in eloquence. and</hi> AVSTIN <hi>in ſcience</hi> &amp;c. And ſaint ISIDORE writeth that not anie doctour of his time, nor of the auncients nether, was compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to him. And as it is in the 8.

                  <p>But that I may end where I began, how farre is the greateſt part of our wretched Countrey fallen from that religion which this <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</note> holy Pope firſt planted therein? Nay ſuch as he him ſelf, and the Apoſtles he ſent were, that is Prieſts and Monks, are now held for wicked traitours, and whatſoeuer ſlanders worſe can be vttered againſt their holy profeſſion and function.

               <p>THE NOBLE King EDWARD lineally deſcended from the royall and auncient bloud of our <hi>English</hi> Kings: and which is farre more famous, being baptiſed by the moſt holy Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> S.

He had allſoe by a ſecond wife an other ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne called <hi>Ethelred.</hi> But EDWARD, that was the elder, being a child of wonderfull great towardlines, carefully auoyded all the laſciuious &amp; enſnaring pleaſures of this world, and endeauoured ſoe to behaue him ſelf towards God, and man, that before all things he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him ſelf moſt pleaſing vnto God, by his worthy integritie of mind and bodie: and to men he became moſt gratefull by his modeſt and courteous carriage in all things; ſhining withall to the world with all induſtrie, wiſedome, and prudence.

nothing daunted herewith, nor mooued from his ſentence; but placing in the midſt the ſigne of the Croſſe which was wont to be carried before him, togeather with other Biſhops of the realme, he conſecrated EDWARD their King: and embraced him euer after while he liued, with a true paternall loue, hauing from his tendreſt yeares, adopted him to be his child. EDWARD therefore hauing taken into his hands the Scepter, and gouernment of the Kingdom, was by CHRIST the greateſt, and chiefeſt King of Kings, directed in the way of truth and iuſtice; and albeit he were ſeated in the height of royall maieſtie, yet he dayly encreaſed more and more in ſubmiſſion, and humilitie of mind. And the better to rule his <note place="margin">His pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in gouerning.</note> Kingdom with the raines of prudence, he refuſed to vſe the counſell of yong Princes, and Lords of light and youthfull heads; but obeyed in all things, the admonitions of the worthie Prelat S.

Moreouer, his dayly exerciſe was to feed and mayntaine the poore, to cloath the naked, and to eſteeme that his greateſt gaine, which he beſtowed in theſe pious works. Wherevppon, through the goodnes of allmightie God, great ioy, ſtedfaſt peace, and wonderfull abundance of wealth, and riches, floriſhed all ouer <hi>England:</hi> to behold their king in the flower of his youth giuen to ſuch pious endeauours, ſoe affable to all men, vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in chaſtitie, pleaſant and comly of countenance, and moſt excelling in prudence, and good counſell.</p>

And at the ſame inſtant he reſolued to forſake his flocks, and embrace a monaſticall life. Therefore, ſhaking off the fetters of the world he departed thence, and entred into the way of heauen, trauelling night, and day alone without eyther meate or drinke, to find out a quiet hauen wherein he might ſecurely harbour at the ſweete ſhore of contemplation. At length he arriued at a Village, where he ſtayed only to refreſh his wearied horſe, for he him ſelf

And from that time, his vertues all waies encreaſing, he was dayly adorned mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re and more with heauenly fauours; for he deſerued often times to ſee, and conuerſe with angels, &amp; to haue his hunger refreſhed with heauenly meates, ſeaſoned by angelicall hands.

And this cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of CHRIST hauing ſubdued the forces of theſe black Tirans, and now made monarke of that little land, he built a cittie befitting his empire, and houſes therein agreeing vnto it.

In this place being viſited by his brethren, he would goe out of his cell to meete them, and waſh their feet with warme water and ſometimes, being compelled therevnto, he would permitt them to waſh his feete. For ſoe farre he had turned his mind from the decking of his bodie, to labour in the adorning of his ſoule, that ſometimes for a whole moneth togeather, nay for the ſpace of a yeare, he did not once putt off his ſhoes.

At that time of his departure being demaunded by one of his ancient monks, when they ſhould hope for his returne: He anſweared; When you ſhall carrie my bodie hither. And hauing paſſed ouer allmoſt two moneths, in the great ioy of his recouered quietnes, bruiſing his mind, and bodie with the rigour of his accuſtomed peanance; being taken with a ſudden infirmitie, he began through the fiers of a temporall grief, to prepare his way to the ſweet ioies, and refreſhments of eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines. Three weekes togeather he was continually afflicted with ſicknes, vppon a wednſday he fell firſt into his diſeaſe, and vppon a wednſday he died. But what ſore grieuances he endured all this time as well by his ſicknes, as the infernall ſpirits, it is not eaſie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe; eſpecially for the ſpace of fiue daies, in which being deſtitute of all humane helpe, and companie, he was not able to mooue out of the place; and being tormented with an extremitie of thirſt, he had nothing wherewith to refreſh him ſelf and quench it, but one poore onion, of which in thoſe fiue dayes ſpace, he had ſcarſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the one half. Then he deſired his brethren to burie him in the ſame Iland of <hi>Farne,</hi> on the Eaſt ſide of his Oratorie nere vnto a Croſſe, which him ſelf had there erected: but being ouercome with the vehement perſuaſions, and earneſt entreaties of the monks of <hi>Lindisfarne,</hi> with much difficultie, he conſented they ſhould burie him in their Church. And at the ſame time, a monk which only touched <note place="margin">Touching the holy Bishop cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the bloudie fluxe.</note> his bodie, as he aſſiſted him in his ſicknes, was cured of an other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe incurable diſeaſe of the blouddie fluxe. At length coming to the extremitie of his infirmitie, which ſcarſe allowed him ſtrength to ſpeake, he began to bid his laſt adiew to his brethren; earneſtly
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:15374:176"/>
recommending vnto them the obſeruance of mutuall peace and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, the care of keeping hoſpitalitie; and aboue all things, he ſtrictly chardged them to remaine in the vnitie of the Church, and in noe ſort to haue anie communication with thoſe, who contrarie to the rites, and cuſtom of the ſame Catholick Church, ſwearued from the <note place="margin">Sciſmatic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques muſt be auoyded</note> true obſeruance of Eaſter: and he wiſhed that they ſhould rather leaue their monaſterie, and goe ſeek an habitation where it ſhould pleaſe God to direct them, then to vnite with ſuch who like Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, celebrated the feaſt of Eaſter at a wrong time. Moroeuer, endeauour moſt diligently (ſayd he) to learne, and obſerue the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick ſtatuts of our forefathers; and particularly be verie carefull to follow thoſe inſtitutions, of regular life, which by my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the diuine goodnes hath voutchafed to beſtow vppon you.

When, through the imminent ſlaughter, which thoſe Barbarians outragiouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the contrey, he could not find a ſecure abode to reſt in; he wandred ſecretly vpp and downe, allwaies carrying with him that Sacred bodie, for the ſpace of ſeauen yeares, hauing <hi>Edred</hi> the Abbott, and ſome others of the Clergie compartners of his flight, and pilgrimage. At laſt hauing loſt all hope of conſeruing them ſelues, and that Sacred monument in <hi>England,</hi> after a mature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, they reſolued to ſayle ouer with it into <hi>Ireland.</hi> But fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the rage of the ſeas, through the horrible tempeſts that aroſe, to be as much againſt their deſires by water, as the ſword of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> by land, they were compelled ſuddenly to returne from their aduenture that way. But in this their entrepriſe at ſea, <note place="margin">Two ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable accidents.</note> there happened two things verie wonderous: for the waues of the ſea, which in a ſtorme furiouſly flowed ouer the decks readie to ouer whelme the ſhip, were ſuddenly chainged into gore bloud, and a goodly booke of the holy ghoſpels, couered with gould, and rich gemmes, by the inclining of the ſhip on the one ſide, fell acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally into the water: and afterwards the ſea retiring it felf for the ſpace of three miles, was againe found in the bottom, without anie domage by lying in the waters, which was preſerued with great care in the Abbey of <hi>Durrham,</hi> vnto the Authours time that writeth this hiſtorie.</p>

But as often as he entred S. CVTHBERTS Church, he was free, and coming forth he was preſently attached againe. Which being a cauſe of great aſtoniſhment to all, and of wonderfull calamitie to the poore man, he went to S. CVTHBERTS, where ſhrine hauing perſeuered three daies, and as manie nights, earneſtly imploring the helpe of God, and the Sainct, he was euer after releaſed from that fearfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance. Which ſtorie this authour aſſeuereth from their words that had ſeene the man. About the ſame time, one that had ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſome peeces of money from S. CVTHBERTS ſhrine, and to conceale his theft putt them into his mouth, on a ſuddaine his chops were miſerably tortured with ſuch an ſufferable paine, as yf they had bin ſeared with hott irons. And endeauouring to ſpitt the money out of his mouth, he was not able, no nor, to ſpeake a word. He ranne vpp and downe the Church nodding, ſtaring, and ſhewing all other ſtrange motions of countenance, and bodie, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to make knowne his torment, which he could not vtter. At length, hoping to gaine a remedie where he had found his ill, he ranne to the Sacred ſhrine, and falling proſtrate on his face, humbly craued the pardon, and aſſiſtance of S. CVTHBERT, offring intereſt of his owne, to expiate the offence committed: where as he embraced, and kiſſed that Sacred treaſurie, with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie kiſſe, the money fell out of his mouth, and he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed <note place="margin">Manie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for iniuries done to his tombe.</note> from his paine. But as men afflicted with diſeaſes, and miſeries, who humbly implored his ayde, receaued oftentimes preſent and wonderfull remedies; ſoe thoſe that were iniurious to this B.

And among others, <hi>Osbert,</hi> and <hi>Ella,</hi> both kings ſlaine by the <hi>Danes,</hi> may witnes; and Duke <hi>Haden</hi> a <hi>Dane,</hi> whom beſides madnes a moſt cruell ſicknes attached, which infected his whole bodie with ſuch an horrid ſtench, that the armie not able to endure his preſence thruſt him out of the camp, &amp;

He had ſcarſe ſayd thus much, when goeing ouer the threſhold, ſuddenly he became immoueable, and falling downe to the ground, vomitted forth his wretched ſoule. <hi>William</hi> Conquerour ſent one called <hi>Ranulphus</hi> to <hi>Durrham,</hi> to exact tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute out of that countrey (which hitherto had bin allwaies free.) To whom S. CVTHBERT appearing in a dreame, with cruell threatnings and a diſeaſe which grieuouſly tormented him, terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him from the execution of his exigent. In whom one thing was wonderfull, that as long as he remayned within the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durrham,</hi> ſoe long he felt the torments of his ſicknes; but he was no ſooner out of thoſe bounds, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was freed.

For when by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of that vnhappie King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, the ſacred chaſſes, and ſhrines of the Saincts were broken vp, and robbed throughout <hi>England,</hi> and their holy reliques caſt by ſacrilegious hands into ignoble places, the wodden cheſt of this ſacred bodie, which was couered with white marble, was likewiſe burſt open with the reſt. And when the bloudie executioner, to whom this work of miſchiefe was committed, with a mightie blow brake vp the cheſt, he pearced to the holy bodie of the Bleſſed Sainct, and cutt a gaſh in his legg, where preſently there appeared a manifeſt ſigne of a wound in the raw fleſh. Which being ſeene, and all the reſt of his bodie found entier (excepting that the extremitie of his noſe, I know not by what chance, was wanting) the matter was brought to <hi>Cuthbert Tunstall</hi> then biſhop of <hi>Durrham,</hi> whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted what was beſt to be done with that bodie: Who commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it ſhould be buried vnder ground, in the ſelf ſame place where his ſacred ſhrine ſtood before. And not only his bodie, but the veſtiments he had on, were found to be whole, and entier, and free from anie the left ſpott or ſigne of corruption. But on his finger was found a gould ring ſett with a ſaphir ſtone, which I (ſayth <hi>Nicholas Harpsfield</hi> my authour) ſometimes ſaw, and handled, embracing, and kiſſing it with great affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as a ſacred monument, more pretious then the greateſt treaſure.

And by this, it is manifeſt, that the ſacred bodie of this glorious Sainct had
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:15374:180"/>
endured inuiolate, and vncorrupted for the ſpace of eight hundred and fortie yeares. A thing, which we haue not read of anie other Sainct in the Church of God who only knowes, whether at this hower it remaine in the ſame integritie or not. And here now perchaunce the vertuous reader may wonder, how it comes to paſſe that the allmightie iuſtice who is euer wonderfull in his Saincts, and who heretofore, as this hiſtorie doth witnes, was ſoe iealous of this his glorious Sainct in particular, that not a man could offer anie iniurie ether to his bodie, his Church, or anie thing thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, but ſtraight he incurred the reuenge of verie ſharp puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet now at the laſt, he permitted his ſacred reliques to be mangled and abuſed, his Church to be ſpoiled, the lands to be alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and all other violence and crueltie, which the wicked hearts of men could allmoſt inuent, to be exerciſed againſt all his Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall perſons &amp; dignities without ſhewing anie outward ſignes of reuenge for his defence! But all theſe things are ſcourges for the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our wretched Countrey; and our Lord it ſeemes hateth ſinne in ſoe high a degree, that he will rather take away the honour due to his Saincts in this world, then let ſinne paſſe vnpuniſhed. O that S.

               <p>SAINCT RICHARD of bleſſed, and neuer dying memorie, was an <hi>Englishman</hi> borne of honeſt parents in <hi>Worceſter-shire,</hi> at a Village which from the ſalt-pitts thereabouts was called the <hi>Wiche;</hi>

From his tendreſt yeares (contrarie to the cuſto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that age) he ſo farre abandoned dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, <note place="margin">His happie witt.</note> plaies, and other ſuch vanities, that his other fellowes and equalls in yeares, could by noe allurements nor perſwaſions draw him thereunto: on the other ſide, within a ſhort time, he farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled all his riualls both in learning, integritie of life, &amp; good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. His elder brother during the time of his nonage, was kept in ward, and by that meanes he came to his lands in great pouertie and want. Whoſe caſe RICHARD much pittied, and hauing not anie thing wherewith to comfort and ſuccour him in that neceſſitie, he <note place="margin">He ſerues his brother</note> gaue him ſelf wholly into his ſeruice, in which he ſpent noe ſmall, time in great pouertie, and abiection, and with noe leſſe patience, humilitie, and modeſtie, toyling, and ſweating now at the plough, now at the cart, and other ſuch hard imployments and labours of husbandrie. Whereby he wonne to him ſelf ſoe great good will and affection from his brother, that by a ſealed writing he aſſured all his lands vppon him. Then his friends and kinsfolks began to treate of a marriage to be ſolemnized between him, and a yong gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of that Countrey. VVhich when his brother perceaued, he beganne to repent that he had reſigned ouer his meanes, becauſe

And he was ſoe violently carried away with a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> extreme loue &amp; deſire to apparell his mind with learning, that he ſcarſe euer thought ether offoode, or apparell for his bodie. For, as him ſelf afterwards was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſay, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was one of the three ſchollers, that liued in one chamber, they had but one capp or hatt betwixt them, &amp; each of them but one gowne. Soe that (like ſome of our courtiers now a dayes) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one of them went forth to leſſon with the hatt, the other two remayned barcheaded at home: And ſoe the ſame capp ſerued them all by turnes to goe heare their lectures.

For their pouertie would not allow them to eate eyther fleſh or fiſh, vnleſſe it were vppon ſundaies, and high dayes, and when their friends, and comrades did inuite them.

But refuſing to take anie degrees at <hi>Paris,</hi> he returned againe to his Countrey, and to the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin a ſhort time, he was promoted to be Maſter of the liberall arts: <note place="margin">He ſtudies Canon law</note> when liberally he imparted that learning to others, which before with much labour he had purchaſed to him ſelf.

Which for more then half a yeare he performed, with ſoe great modeſtie, &amp; readines of witt and iudgement, that he purchaſed to him ſelf great affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; praiſe throughout all the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie; &amp; gott ſoe high a place of fauour and good will with his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that he deſired, and aſpired to nothing more willingly then to giue him his only daughter in marriage. But RICH.

And taking leaue of his maſter, &amp; his daughter in this ſort, he returned into <hi>England,</hi> to the vniuerſitie of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he led a verie rigid, &amp; auſtere life, in <note place="margin">He is made Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</note> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall labours, watching, &amp; other bodily afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

Then B. EDMOND deliuered vnto him the great ſeale of his office and committed to his chardge the managing of the graueſt, and principalleſt affayres of his whole Dioceſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore RICHARD began according to his wonted diligence to clime dayly higher, and higher in the exerciſe of good endeauours, fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and exactly to performe his office without anie pride or ſtate, to keepe free his hands from bribes, knowing, that according to ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>guifts doe blind the eyes of wiſemen, and varie the words of the iuſt.</hi> One might behould in him, an vnſpeakable equitie, a courteous mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and modeſt ſimplicitie, all ſeated &amp; grounded in an excellent <note place="margin">Dent. 16. v. 19.</note> prudence, and humilitie: his geſture and actions well compoſed and tempered.

And from that time, he began to adorne that heauenly function with a more humble plainnes, and neate humblenes in his habitt. But after he had been long conuerſant in the ſtudies of ſacred ſcripture, he returned into <hi>England,</hi> to feed the ſmall flock committed to his chardge; for he had but one pariſh wherein he would beſtow his neceſſarie care in doeing the office of a good Paſtour</p>
               <p>
                  <label>IV.</label> BONIFACE, a verie venerable man, had allreadie ſucceeded bleſſed EDMOND in the ſea of <hi>Canturbury</hi> who deſired allſoe to enioy the conuerſation, and familiaritie of RICHARD, that was ſoe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in the world. Vnto whom, (making great reſiſtance) he <note place="margin">He is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen bishop of Chice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</note> recommended his auncient office of chauncelour. In the meane time, <hi>Radulph Neuill</hi> biſhop of <hi>Chiceſter</hi> being dead; the Canons, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing firſt, as the cuſtom was, obtained leaue of the King then <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the third, made choice of one <hi>Robert Paſſeleff</hi> (who from a mig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at Court was becom a Canon of that Church) to be their biſhop. But that election (according to the decrees of the Canons, by the authoritie of <hi>Boniface</hi> of <hi>Canturbury,</hi> and other biſhops his ſuffragans, among whom was <hi>Robert</hi> the venerable biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne)</hi> was vtterly diſanulled, and declared to be of noe force, becauſe the perſon elected was in learning life, and manners iudged to be little correſpondent to ſoe high a dignitie: and by the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and ſentence of all, RICHARD was choſen in his place.

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:15374:184"/>
he commaunded all the goods of <hi>Chiceſter</hi> Church to be confiſcated. When S. RICHARD, according to the counſell of the others Biſhops, gott the letters of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canturbury,</hi> and went to the King, humbly entreating his Maieſtie, to ſuffer a reſtitution to be made of all that belonged to the Church of <hi>Chicester.</hi> But all his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie could nothing remoue the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong King from his ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne reſolution: ſoe that, when the holy man had much tired and wearied out him ſelf in vaine, and endured manie contumelious, and ſcornfull iniuries, he was conſtrained at length to haue recourſe to <note place="margin">Richard appealeth to Rome.</note> the laſt refuge (vnder God) on earth, the Sea Apoſtolique. When the Kings Embaſſadours had preuented him with the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> for he found them there all readie, readie prouided againſt him. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> the fourth, then gouerned the <hi>Roman</hi> ſea, who verie curteou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly entertayned RICHARD, and hauing heard the reaſons of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he confirmed his election by Apoſtolicall authoritie, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer, by the impoſition of his ſacred hands, conſecrated him Biſhop, (with an other of that Countrey) in great ſolemnitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>V.</label> BVT a wonderfull thing happened at his conſecration. For coming to giue them ſacred vnction, for the firſt the Pope couid hardly ſqueeze one dropp of oile out of the box; but when RI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHARD came to be anneild, there appeared as it were a new repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of <hi>Elias</hi> his oile and miracle, for the ſacred liquour ranne in ſuch abundance out of the viole, that the attendants had enough to doe to ſtopp it with linnen cloathes, from flowing ouer into his neck, and ſhoulders. The Pope and Cardinals and all the aſſiſtants <note place="margin">A ſtrange miracle.</note> were much amazed, and not without cauſe: when one of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls ſayd: Certaynly this man abounds with a fullnes of diuine grace. Then S. RICHARD returning into his Countrey with the Popes letters, by the way viſited the Sepulcher of S. EDMOND, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie floriſhing with miracles, at <hi>Pontoiſe</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> and coming into <hi>England</hi> he found all the goods and meanes belonging to his Church of <hi>Chiceſter,</hi> vtterly diſſipated, and ſpent by the Kings of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiceers. And for an increaſe of miſerie, the King had commaunded by publick edict, that noe man ſhould lend him a pennie, to ſupply <note place="margin">His affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious in the Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptick.</note> his wants. But when he exibited the Popes letters, and commaunds before the King and his nobles, he not only fayled to gett a gracious fauour, but contrary wiſe, rather purchaſed to him ſelf much more
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:15374:185"/>
hatred, and indignation. Wherefore, departing from before that incenſed Maieſtie, he went in poore, and bare array, to his Dioceſſe, where he liued as a priuate gueſt at an other mans houſe, and table. In the meane time, he omitted not ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times to take a circuite about his dioceſſe, viſitting the flock committed to his charge, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the ſacraments as occaſion required. And leſt he ſhould be accuſed as a ſlouthfull, and ſluggiſh forſaker, and traitour of his owne right, ſometimes he would make a iourney to the King, and humbly demaund the reſtitution of the goods, wrongfully taken away, allbeit he allwaies ſuffered a ſcornfull repulſe, and returned loden with iniuries, and reproches. It happened once that the Deane and Canons of <hi>Chiceſter,</hi> were much trobled and afflicted in mind, with the kings ſharp and biting anſwers but the holy man, putting on a cheerfull, cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, would comfort them with calling that ſaying of the ſcripture to their remembrance. <hi>The Apostles went reioycing from the face of the Councell, becauſe they were eſteemed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi>

                  <hi>to ſuffer contumelic for the name of</hi> CHRIST-IESVS. And I confirme you in the ſame, that theſe croſſes, and afflictions will one day <note place="margin">The Church of Chiceſtet reſtored.</note> be changed into mirth, and ioy. But within a while he made the Pope acquainted with the kings ſtubborne anſwer and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: who wonderfully much pittying the holie mans caſe, ſent a thundring commaund vnto two biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> to admoniſh the King to make reſtitution to the Church of <hi>Chiceſter</hi> within ſuch a time, or that they ſhould publiſh and denounce the heauie ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences contayned in his letters, ouer the whole Kingdom. By which meanes, after two yeares affliction patiently endured, the Church with her demaines, and torne buildings, readie to tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into ruine, were with difficultie reſtored againe to their true owner.</p>

A happy ſigne, &amp; precurſour of his birth, foreſhewing that in his life time he ſhould allwaies carrie in his bodie the peanance of Chriſts holy croſſe. But the multitude of poeple much aſtoniſhed, &amp; amazed at this vnacuſtomed ſpectacle, began (as the manner is) with diuers, and doubtfull opinios to wauer in their ſundrie expoſitions of that diuine miracle, the greateſt part affirming that ſurely it betokened ſome great &amp; heauenly miſterie: when the mid wiue came forth with newes that the child, for whoſe ſake that wonder appeared, was borne. In baptiſme he was named GVTHLAKE, and during the time of his childhood, he appeared to beare in a cleere &amp; louing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſoe gratefull and acceptable a grace, that his ſole looks were of force ſufficient to purchaſe loue in the minds &amp; hearts of all men.</p>

At le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth calling to mind (by a diuine inſpiration) the lamentable ends of manie great kings and princes of his anceſtors, and conſidering that the ſecular
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:15374:191"/>
pompe of the world is but as a puffe of ſmoake, and a vapour quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaniſhing: and remembring the ſhortnes of mans daies, the vneer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of his death, the terrour of his departure out of this life, the ſeueritie of Gods tribunall, and the eternitie of the paines in the life to come, he reſolued to giue ouer that courſe of life: and calling his fellow ſouldiers togeather he bad them adiew in theſe words: Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therunto (my deare friends,) I haue waged warre in the regiment of the worlds vanities, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence forth I am determined to beare armes only vnder the enſignes of IESVS-CHRIST, our true and deareſt cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.

And noe reaſons nor prayers being able to turne him from this pious reſolution, he caſt of his martiall armes, and went to the famous monaſterie of <hi>Benedictin</hi> monkes at <hi>Ripendown,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Mercia,</hi> where hauing taken the habitt <note place="margin">He beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictine monk.</note> of a monk vnder the holy rule of S.

The Pſalmes, himnes, and other knowledge of holy ſcripture he learned with a wonderfull facilitie within the ſpace of two yeares. He was of a pleaſant cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, humble in his behauiour, and gate, religious and full of the feare of God in his workes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant in fayth, <note place="margin">His man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie.</note> perſeuerant in hope, abounding in charitie, prouidet in his counſell, and verie circomſpect, &amp; mild in his words. And liuing amongſt his brethren, he imitated the diligent &amp; laborious bee, which auoyding all infectious weeds, ſucks whatſoeuer is good and profitable out of all the ſweet flowers round about and brings it to her hiue. For as he highly deteſted all manner of vice, ſoe he ſtriued and endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a great contention of mind, to expreſſe in him ſelf, not only one, but all the good manners and vertues of thoſe with whom he liued. Therefore, whatſoeuer was excellent, or notable in each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he heaped it all to him ſelf; the learning of one, the continencie of an other, this mans pacience, the others ſubmiſſion, &amp; humilitie, the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of ſome, the ſtrict diet of others, and their night and day watchings; and in a word, he ranked into him ſelf alone a goodly traine or lift of all others vertues, and pious actions.</p>

Therefore, hauing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated his purpoſe with his Abbott and brethren, with their good leaue, and well-wiſhes, he was diſmiſſed to his owne choiſe; and he choſe him ſelf an habitation in the Iland of <hi>Crowland</hi> in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coluethire,</hi> a place at that time moſt remote from all humane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, and which (as well for manie fennes, marſhes and rude groues thereof, as allſoe through feare and horrour of deuils, and gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins that moleſted it) was neuer before inhabited by anie.

Hauing built a little cottage, he vſed for his cloathing the raw, and rude skinnes of beaſts: his diet was a ſmall quantitie of barley bread, and water, which he did not taſt till after ſunn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſett.

Therefore goe on couragiouſly, for allbeit our Lord permitt the to be tempted, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he will make thy temptations redound to thy greater good. Thou art cruelly ſett vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be ouerthrowne, but I haue made interceſſion for thee, that they fayth doe noe fayle; thou art aſſiſted from aboue, our Lord hath putt to his helping hand.

pleaſure that thoſe whom he loueth be tempted &amp; tried; in all which thou muſt behaue thy ſelf as his ſeruant with patience: and yf thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with tribulation ſuffered for CHRIST, thou ſhalt receaue a ſuperabundance of conſolation through CHRIST.

Afterwards, he came into <hi>South-wales,</hi> where he built manie Churches and monaſteries in the Countrey now called <hi>Cardigan-shire,</hi> and ordered them according to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticall rules and diſciplines of thoſe times; in ſoe much that in that countrey, he gayned his greateſt opinion of ſainctitie, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But ſome iarres ariſing betweene the kings of <hi>Southwalles</hi> and <hi>North-wales,</hi> which were readie to be decided but by the ſword, by the mediation of S.

Great was the familiaritie and friendſhip which grew betweene theſe three Saincts, DAVID, TTELIAN, and PATERNVS: And they three deuided all <hi>Wales</hi> into three biſhopricks, one whereof fell to the ſhare of S.

But <hi>Sampſon</hi> Biſhop, who aboue all other was magnified in that prouince for

vertue and holines of life, vſed him with great honour, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as well becomed ſoe great a ſainct. And allbeit by the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome of his brethren he once yeelded to make triall of S. PATERNVS his obedience, and ſainctitie, (which was then teſtified vnto him by a wonderfull miracle) yet afterwards he humbly craued pardon, and became his verie great friend, and defender againſt the other biſhops, that impugned him, commaunding that the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ſea of S. PATERNVS, which was in the towne called <hi>Guenet,</hi> ſhould be free from all externe authoritie. At length, when peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on all ſides, S. PATERNVS hauing gouerned his Church ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie yeares in a miraculous ſainctitie of life in this world, he departed hence to receaue an immortall recompence of his labours, the fifteenth of <hi>Aprill.</hi> The Inhabitans of little <hi>Britanie</hi> obſerue three fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiuall daies in honour of this ſainct, the day of the peacemaking with the other biſhops; the firſt of <hi>Nouember;</hi> the day he was made Biſhops; and this day of his depoſition; which is allſoe yearly celebrated with great honour among the <hi>Welchmen;</hi> in a Church dedicated to him called in <hi>Welch, Llanpaternan</hi> that is ſaint Paternus <hi>Church.

Then lifting vp that ſacred treaſure on their ſhoulders they carried it to the water ſide, the king and Archbiſhop following after: who in the meane time had diſpoſed garriſons throughout the cittie, and on both ſides of the riuer <hi>Thames,</hi> to preuent all occaſion of tumult among the cittizens.

Well doeing which other men gett by labour, &amp; induſtrie, ſeemed to be in him by nature, ſince he had conſecrated his infancie through the ignorance of vice, and emulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vertue. Being ſett to ſchoole, he profitted beyond all his other fellowes. He had ſcarſe ſeene fifteen yeares of age, but ſtraight he began with a graue prudence to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider with him ſelf of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, &amp; miſeries of the world, plotti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g how he might better ſettle him ſelf in the true ſeruice of God; when he reſolued that noe manner of life was comparable to that of monks, &amp; religious men. Therefore being deſirous to leaue the world, &amp; become a monk, he asked the <note place="margin">S.

to allmightie God to ſend him ſome corporall ſicknes that ſoe at leſt he might become a monk and a Patient in Religion, to cure the diſeaſes (or rather conſerue the innocencie) of his ſoule. His prayers were heard and his requeſt graunted: when languiſhing in his deſired ſicknes, he ſent to the Abbot with manie earneſt entreaties to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into his order, for that now he feared death was at hand. But he, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame humane reſpects as before, againe denied his petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>II.</label> AFTERWARDS, his health returning againe, worldly pleaſures and proſperities ſoe ſweerly ſmiled vppon him now in the flower of his youth, that the feruour of his former purpoſes and deſires, began by little a little to grow cold (eſpecially after the death of his good mother, whom he highly loued and reſpected) &amp; he tooke againe to him ſelf free ſcope to follow the inclination and deſires of his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall appetits; not only forgetting the ſpiritt of his firſt Vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but allſoe omitting his ſtudie in ſciences, which before he had ſoe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <note place="margin">His fathers anger againſt him.</note> followed. But while thus he hunted in the traine of his owne paſſions, it pleaſed allmightie God to looke vpon him with the ey of a mercifull clemencie, and permitted his father to enter into ſuch an extreme diſlike of him, that he could not affoord him as much as a good looke, hating, and diſdayning in his ſonne, as well the good, as the euill: when on the other ſide, nether his filiall humilitie, or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, was of power to appeaſe, or anie way ſatisfie his angrie father. Wherevppon he choſe rather to renounce all his worldly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then to endure the ſtormes of ſuch furie, fearing to runne the hazard of further inconuenience. Therefore, iudging his friends and domeſticques to be his greateſt enemies, he forſoke his fathers houſe to ſeeke his content and repoſe elſe-where. He departed with one only companion, &amp; partly in <hi>France</hi> partly in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> he ſpent the ſpace of three yeares. But the worthie fame of <hi>Lanfranks</hi> pietie and learning coming to his eares, he ranged him ſelf into the liſt of manie other yong men of his vertuous ſchoole, in the <hi>Benedictin</hi> Abbey of <note place="margin">He beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſchol ler to Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frank.</note> 
                  <hi>Bec</hi> in <hi>Normandy.</hi> When it was rare to ſee, how ANSELME was not ſoe ioyfull to be a ſcholler of ſoe excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a maſter, as <hi>Lanfrank</hi> was glad to be a maſter to ſoe worthy a ſcholler. The maſters care and labour in teaching, was rewarded in the ſcholler with an extraordinarie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of learning what he taught, in ſoe much that in a ſhort time, he not only made a great progreſſe into the knowledge of holy
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:15374:210"/>
ſcriptures, and other good doctrine, but allſoe exerciſing him ſelf in watching, and prayer, and other actes of deuotion, he became verie deſirous to attaine to the height of vertuous perfection. For the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar conuerſation he vſed with his good and vertuous maſter S. LANFRANK cauſed the light of his auncient reſolution towards a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticall life, againe like a fayre morning of pietie, to breake out through the clouds of worldly vanities, wholly to dedicate him ſelf to Gods ſeruice: True it is that he was much perplext with difficulties to attayne the end he aymed at. On the one ſide he found him ſelf greatly inclined to lead a ſolitarie life in the deſert, thereby to applie and employ his thoughts more ſecurely in diuine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation: on the other ſide, he thought it a more ſecure way, to liue vnder the rod of obedience in a monaſterie: againe (his father hauing left him heyre of great lands, and goods) he was in doubt, whether he might not doe God greater ſeruice, liuing in the world, and yearly diſtributing the beſt part of his meanes to the poore, &amp; pious vſes. In theſe perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties this prudent yong man would not of him ſelf reſolue anie thing, in a matter of ſoe great moment, but conſulted his maſter LAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FRANK, ſincerely laying open the ſecret thoughts of his heart, fully <note place="margin">He conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frank of chooſing a courſe of life.</note> reſigning his will into his hands, with intention to follow the dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of his good counſell. The maſter was vnwilling to reſolue his ſcholler, in a matter of ſuch importance, but referred it to the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the venerable Prelat <hi>Maurill</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Roane:</hi> vnto whom they went both, and propoſed their difficultie: who, hauing heard the cauſe, counſelled ANSELME to embrace a religious and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticall life, as the moſt perfect, and aſſured way to heauen; and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing this aduiſe he reſolued to humble his neck vnder the ſweet yoake of CHRIST in the holy order of Sainct BENEDICT.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>III.</label> BVT THERE remayned yet an other difficultie, of chooſing the place, whether he ſhould take the habitt at <hi>Cluny,</hi> or <hi>Bec:</hi> at the firſt, he thought his labour, and learning might be to manie profitable, at the other, he feared it would, like a little ſtarre before the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, be darkened with the bright ſplendour of LANFRANK, and ſoe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of little or noe ſeruice at all. While his thoughts were toſſed with theſe wauering opinions, he began to diſcourſe with him ſelf in this ſort: Why ANSELME what doſt thou meane? what doeſt thou think on? Doeſt thou inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to make a monaſticall life the firſt ſtepp
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:15374:211"/>
to obtaine fame, glorie, renowne, and ſuperioritie? God forbid: For the true ſcope of a monke, muſt be to humble him ſelf to others, and <note place="margin">He taketh the habitt of S Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.</note> vtterly to deſpiſe all titles of honour &amp; dignitie. And this thou wilt attaine to at the Abbey of <hi>Bec,</hi> or noe where. Therefore without all delay, he went thither &amp; putt on the habitt of S. BENEDICTS order in the ſayd monaſtery, where the venerable man <hi>Hurluin</hi> was Abbot, who out of his owne meanes and patrimonie had firſt built, &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that Abbey. ANSELME was then at the age of 27. yeares, when he became ſoe carefull, &amp; attentiue to imitate the vertues of his other brethren, that at the terme of three yeares, he became him ſelf to be a bright mirrour of religious perfection, and monaſticall diſcipline to the whole conuent. Soe that B. LANERANK being taken from the Priorſhip to be made Abbot of the monaſtery of <hi>Cane,</hi> ANSELME much againſt his will was created Prior in his place. Which title of <note place="margin">He is made Priour.</note> honour did not only, not hinder him in the way to perfection, but was rather a meanes more freely to applie him ſelf thereunto, by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall practiſe of diuine conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation, &amp; heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly diſcipline follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed with ſoe great feruour, that he attayned to ſuchan height of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, that he diſcouered, &amp; maintained with euident reaſons, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie queſtions, and aſſertions of the diuine nature, neuer heard off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time. Lying one night awake in his bed, he had manie doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thoughts, how the Prophets did not only ſee things preſent, but things to come allſoe, foretelling them as diſtinctly as they had been preſent. And being not able to perceaue how this might be, his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding laboured with an incredible deſire to be reſolued in this poynt: when on a ſuddaine fixing his eyes towards the Church and dorter, by the meanes of a diuine light, the beames of his eyes pierced through all the walls interpoſed, and ſhewed him the monks (whoſe office it was) adorning the aultar, preparing the quier for the ſinging <note place="margin">He ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He had ſoe great force and efficacie in giuing of counſell that the verie ſpiritt of all good counſell ſeemed, as in a throne, to rule and raigne in his breaſt. His continuall exerciſes in faſting, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, prayer, and other mortifications of bodie to bring it ſubiect to the ſpiritt, were ſuch, and ſoe great, that they deſerue rather to be admired then writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In faſting, he had gott ſuch a naturall habit, that he was nether moleſted with hunger, nor delighted in ſatisfying his hunger with eating.

This ſweet, and meeke ſpiritt, which our Lord beſtowed vppon him, appeared more cleerly in that which paſſed betweene him and a yong monk called <hi>Osberne,</hi> one of a piercing witt, and good abilitie, but a verie libertine in his manners; of a turbulent, and detracting ſpiritt, and in all things ſoe contrarie to his ſuperiour that he diſdayned to giue him a good looke, when he was admoniſhed to follow the rules of modeſtie, and vertue.

Of this kind he vnderſtood manie to be in <hi>Germanie,</hi> whence the <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Saxons</hi> had their beginning; and therefore to them he prepared him ſelf to announce the glad tidings of the Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.

EG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERT hearing this ſecond replie, againe commaunded the monk to keepe it ſecret. And howbeit he were allmoſt certaine of the truth of the viſion, yet ſuch was his conceipt of his foretaken re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and ſoe great was his zeale to gaine ſoules to God, that togeather with his fellowes prepared, he aduentured to begin his iourney.

And he (as it were alluding to that ſaying of the holy Prophete <hi>Jonas,</hi> becauſe <hi>for my ſake this tempeſt happeneth)</hi> withdrew him ſelf from

And ſome of theſe apoſtolicall men (which greatlie redounds to the prayſe of Sainct EGBERT) were his ſchollers, bred, and brought vp to that eminent calling, with the ſweet milk of his learning, vertue, and diſcipline. Afterward in the yeare of our Lord 716. ſainct EGBERT following the diuine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle ſent from heauen went to S. COLV<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds and leſſons, was moſt willingly heard of them all, till by his pious adonitions &amp; exemplar life, he drew them from the inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their forefathers, to obſerue the Catholick Eaſter and to weare their hayre ſhauen in forme of a crowne. And at the very ſame time, by the meanes of S. EGBERT thoſe monks receaued the holy rule of S. BENEDICT, which they obſerued euer after. He remayned the ſpace of thirteene yeares in the ſame monaſterie which with the beames of a new grace of the Eccleſiaſticall diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and the ſocietie, and peace of CHRIST, he had conſecrated to his honour.

When behould to their great admiration and comfort, the water which in his life time had giuen <note place="margin">A ſtrange miracle.</note> him free paſſage, now allſoe diuided it ſelf into two parts, that (like vnto the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> loaden with the Arke of our Lord) they paſſed drie foote through the midſt of the riuer. And that noe ſooner done, but an other miracle followed, for the candles by his bodie, which had been extinguiſhed were ſuddenly lighted without mans help, by a light from heauen. Soe that two elements at once gaue a double teſtimonie of his great vertue and ſanctitie. And as in his life he was repleniſhed with manie wonderfull ſpirituall graces and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues ſoe at his death as manie ſick as touched the biere whereon his bodie lay receaued perfect health and were cured of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes.</p>

thoſe outrageous gueſts; the people were ſtricken with greater grief with the thought of looſing the ſacred reliques of ſoe great a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone, then with the ſight of their owne harmes. But allmightie God was zealous and carefull of the glorie of his Sainct; For when <note place="margin">His tombe miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fier.</note> the Church was wholly in flames when the lead powred downe on all ſides, when whole beames of fier came tumbling to the earth, amidſt all this dolefull wrack of ruine, where the conqueſt was the death of the conquerour, the ſacred tombe of ſainct ERKENWALD, allbeit of drie wood apt to take fier remayned moſt free and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched. And which is more, the cloath that couered it (when the two Biſhops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Winceſter,</hi> came to be eye-witneſſes of this miracle) was found moſt pure without anie hurt; where the piercing force of the melted lead, and eating fier, was of noe force againſt the vertue and meritts of this worthie ſainct. O wonderfull ſight whatſoeuer was in the Church within the power of fier, was turned to aſhes, and yet in the midſt of all, the palle of his ſepulcher was not one threed the worſe, eyther in matter, or colour. The poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple flocke thither in troupes to be witneſſes of that ſtrainge ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, giuing manie thanks to allmightie God for his goodnes; when the noueltie of this miracle baniſhed out of their minds all thought of their owne misfortune receiued. <hi>Mauritius</hi> then biſhop <note place="margin">Mauritius Bishop of London.</note> of <hi>London</hi> layd the foundation of the mightie Church of S.

When the deuill enuying ſoe great ſainctitie in ſainct FREMVND, with manie grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous batteries of temptations ſought to ouerthrow his godly reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; bringing into his memory the pompe and glory of the world ly dignitie which he had forſaken, and filling his mind with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thoughts of the great good which his youtfull dayes might haue brought to his countrey. But he found this ſouldier of CHRIST ſoe firme a rock, that all his vaine aſſaults could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhake nor ſtirre him from the ſeate and ground of vertue: for hauing his heart alltogeather erected towards heauen and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things, he loathed to returne againe to the vanities of the world once deſpiſed for the loue of CHRIST; therefore well might he be wearied with the temptations of the deuill, but ouercome he could not be. <note place="margin">He is ſent for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Countrey.</note>

In <hi>Ireland</hi> there liued a verie potent King, but a <hi>Heathen,</hi> who had married a fayre woman, whom, as well in regard <note place="margin">Her father a Pagan king.</note> of her beautie, as her other goods parts, he dearly loued. Out of this marriage was borne a daughter called DIMPNA nothing behind her mother in beautie, whom her parents verie carefully and dainti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought vp: Neuertheleſſe, as ſoone as ſhe had attayned to yeares of diſcretion coming to the knowledge of IESVS CHRIST, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Chriſtian, and vowed perpetuall virginitie vnto him, vtterly <note place="margin">She vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her virginitie to God.</note> deſpiſing all the Pompes, banquets, dances, and other vanities of the Court.

But fayling to find ſuch an one in the countrey, his flattring courtiers perſwaded him to caſt his eyes vppon his daughter DIMPNA, then whom, none could be fayrer, and in whom (being verie like her mother) he might reuiue the figure of his late <note place="margin">Her father <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

He reſolued to goe ſeeke her him ſelf, and to ſearch the verie bowells of the earth to find her, where ſoeuer ſhe was hid. He trauelled all his countrey ouer, and found noe newes of her. He paſſed ouer the ſeas to <hi>Antwerp</hi> where, he made ſome ſtay, whilſt his ſeruants ferretted all the countrey ouer for his daughter: when by meere accident, ſome of them, hauing lodged in a village thereabouts, payed their hoſt with their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey money, who tould them that he had ſome money of the ſame kind, but knew not the value of it: Theſe <hi>Jrishmen</hi> demaunded of the hoſt how he came by it: he anſwered (not imagining to what purpoſe they asked) that a very beautifull virgin, come out of <hi>Jre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to liue in thoſe parts, gaue it him in payment for ſuch neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <note place="margin">She is found.</note> as belonged to her maintenance: this gaue them ſufficient ground to ſuſpect, and indeed to preſume that it was the kings daughter they ſought, therefore by the Hoſts direction they went and found her, and returned with the glad newes thereof to her father.</p>

Why haſt thou thus deſpiſed the royall court who art the only heyreſſe of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> after thy father?

Then the kings luſt turned into furie, and his loue into a deadly hate; the more he found the feruour of Chriſtian religion to boyle in the breſt of his daughter, the more fiercely he endeauoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert her. And doe not think (ſayd he) to wearie and delude me with thy vaine anſwers, eyther ſuddenly graunt what I aske, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to feele the ſmart of thy fathers anger, as thy impoſtour <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reberne</hi> hath done, who hath loſt his head for the libertie of his tongue.</p>

His bodie was buried with great honour in the ſame monaſterie, till in proceſſe, of time the manie ſignes and miracles wrought at his tomb, moued the monks and poeple to tranſlate it out of the earth, and place it in a ſhrine neere vnto that of his Maſter S.

And whatſoeuer honour, dutie, or curteſie was ſhewed vnto him, <note place="margin">He taketh the minor orders.</note> he wholly aſcribed to the grace of the doers and not to anie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or deſerts of his, being moſt readie to ſerue others, and moſt vnwilling to accept others ſeruice towards him ſelf. In the meane time, he is perſuaded by his friends to range him ſelf into the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Church, and take vppon him the <hi>Leſſer Orders:</hi> Which willingly he did, thereby to be able more freely to, frequent the Church, to light the candles, to ſerue the Prieſt at Maſſe, to reade and ſing in the office, and doe other inferior duties belonging to the diuine ſeruice.

And when at anie time he was inuited by his fellowes in yeares to recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate with them in worldly vanities, he was wont to excuſe him ſelf with his employment about ſuch and ſuch Church-affaires, and that he muſt neceſſaryly looke before hand ouer theſe and theſe Anthimes and Leſſons that were to be ſung or ſayd in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſeruice.

Whence it came to paſſe, that he obtayned the grace both to ſearch out diuine things, and truſting in the dayly conſideration of God, auoyded all ſpott of ſinne.

The height was proportionable to the ordinarie ſtature of a man. In the midſt of the doore was a litle window.

And now the hower of the diuine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was come, when the holy Biſhop went ioyfully to the Aultar to ſacrifice the Sonne of God to his eternall Father.

Then retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the aultar, he finiſhed that dreadfull ſacrifice, and being come to the Benediction at the end of Maſſe (which by biſhops is more ſolemnly giuen) he went againe into the pulpit, where ſoe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably he treated of the reall preſence, of the future reſurrection of our bodies, &amp; of the ioies of euerlaſting life, that one vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">The reall preſence.</note> with him before, would haue iudged thoſe words to haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded from the mouth of an Angell. This done, he returned to the aultar, and ſolemnly gaue the poeple his benediction. But being much wounded in his mind with a pious feare, leſt his deareſt friends and children being ſtrucken with the ſudden blow of his death, ſhould grieue more vehemently, then they would being forewarned of that dolefull ſeparation, to the great admiration of all he went the third time to the poeple: Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he noe ſooner ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull brightnes of his face.</note> his mouth to ſpeake, but like an other <hi>Moyſes</hi> his face ſhined with ſuch glittering beames of glorie, that not one of all that huge aſſemblie, was able to fixe his ſight vppon him.

But when the Seruant of God began to diſcouer the day of his death, then all that mirth was turned to mourning, and ſuch mourning, that DVNSTAN him ſelf, who was now deſtined to euerlaſting ioies, being mooued with naturall pittie and compaſſion, ſeemed to beare a part in that dolefull conſort.

Thus conquering the ſtrength of his diſeaſe with the weapons of a fir me fayth and deuotion, he paſſed ouer that day, till the morow (which was the laſt of his labours and firſt of his deſired reſt) arriued. Then the Clergie and poeple flocked about him with a fearfull expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the euent which he had foretould of him ſelf.

Where, as among other prayſes of Allmightie God, it was declared, that now (as at other times the poore) ſaint DVNSTAN had cured a great and famous man allſoe, he became very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and diſdainfull: And doe yee reckon me (ſayd he) among thoſe wretched creatures?

                  <label>XXVI.</label> FVRTHERMORE, two ſouldiers that had flaine the nephew of an Abbot called <hi>Scotland,</hi> made humble ſuite vnto him in a great aſſemblie at the reliques of S.

Whom when they could not moue to mercie, behould at the ſame time a woeman, that from her cradle had wanted the vſe of hearing, was miraculouſly cured. The night following, a Prieſt of a venerable aſpect appeared to the Abbot in his ſleepe, and ſharply rebuking him for his pittileſſe mind towards thoſe ſupplica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded certaine vglie creatures to caſt him and his nephewes into a boyling cauldron.

But the next day before the

                  <label>XXVII.</label> Whilſt <hi>Lanfrancke</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>turbury</hi> celebrated the dreadfull ſacrifice of Maſſe, a yong monke that ſerued him was horribly vexed with the deuill, of whom for the ſpace of ſome daies, he could by noe meanes be deliuered. Being brought <note place="margin">A poſſeſſed perſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered.</note> afterwards to the ſepulcher of Sainct DVNSTAN, it was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſee how that helliſh fiend did abhorre to come neere thoſe ſacred reliques: but ranne vp and downe that troubled litle world, as yf he would breake out eyther at his mouth, or through ſome other vncleane part of his bodie. In the meane time a monke called <hi>Eifwine,</hi> caught the croſſe which was wont to be carried before Sainct DVNSTAN when he was Archbiſhop, and applied it to the bodie of the afflicted perſon, ſorrowfully powring out theſe words: Holy DVNSTAN looke vppon this wretched creature, and ſhew thy mercie. He had ſcarſe ſpoken ſoe much, but the deuill was baniſhed out of that poſſeſſed lodging, and the monke with teares of ioy gaue humble thankes vnto Sainct DVNSTAN, through whoſe merits he was deliuered from that helliſh Monſter. In the meane time a very memorable thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. For this poſſeſſed creature being viſited by ſome of the monkes whilſt he was in extremitie, ſeemed to be wonderfully <note place="margin">See the great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> reioyced at their coming, openly caſting to their teeth manie offences by them hiddenly committed, and triumphing that he ſhould haue them to be the companions of his damnation. Which thing made them greatly aſhamed, and compelled them preſently to make a ſincere confeſſion of all their ſinnes to a Prieſt, and humbly to deſire abſolution. This ſacred expiation of their ſoules being done, againe they returned to the poſſeſſed perſon, who looking vppon them with a frowning countenance. And whence come yee (ſayd he) or with what ablution haue yee ſoe ſoone waſht away your vncleannes, and robbed me of your companie? Theſe words he bellowed out with great exclamations, dreadfully fuming &amp; foaming at the mouth. Whereby it appeares that ſinnes reucaled in confeſſion are hidden from the knowledge of the deuill. But
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:15374:251"/>
this wretched creature being at length diſpoſſeſſed, as is aforeſayd, became more carefull and feruent in the ſeruice of allmightie God, and died happyly; whoſe example cauſed manie of the other Monkes piouſly to reforme their liues euer after. And of this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie, the Authour whom me doe follow, was an eye-witnes.

And at the ſame inſtant one that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued LANFRANCK at Maſſe was cured of a quartan ague, which had cruelly ſhaken him the ſpace of eight moneths before.</p>

of vertue and learning to his brethren, and of buildings, lands, and reuenewes was added to the monaſterie, that he may deſeruedly be eſteemed as the father and builder of them. But the greateſt donation of lands came chiefly from <hi>Elentherius</hi> Biſhop of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> from <hi>Kenfrith</hi> Duke of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and from the three good Kings <hi>Ethelred, Cedwall,</hi> and <hi>Inas;</hi> who all held ſaint ALDELME in great eſteeme and veneration by reaſon of his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vertue; as manifeſtly appeares by their charters and writings made to that Monaſterie for his ſake, which I haue read. He built allſoe the Monaſteries of <hi>Frome</hi> and <hi>Bradford,</hi> which eyther by the crueltie of the <hi>Danes,</hi> or other ſuch barbarous poeple, or elſe by the iniuries of eating age haue been deſtroyed manie yeares agoe.

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the victorie iudged to be of great difficultie if ALDELME did but take the matter in hand. He vndertooke it, and worthily and fruitfully performed it, as we haue ſayd before: Soe that the <hi>Britans,</hi> next after God, are much obliged vnto ſaint ALDELME in this behalf. Whoſe great pietie towards them is allſoe honourably to be obſerued; becauſe he exactly made his prayers vnto allmigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God for them, for whoſe amendment he writt, and his holy prayers tooke a fruitfull and happie effect.</p>

Whereby ſaint ALDELME freed his friend from the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of infamie, and purchaſed an increaſe of loue, fauour, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration to him ſelf. And theſe things are not only reherſed for truths by our Authour, and others whom it were a temeritie to reiect, but allſoe (which moues me more) theſe amongſt other the like, were curiouſly engraued in the outſide of the old cheſt in which his ſacred reliques were kept, long before our Authours time.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>VI.</label> THE Pope greatly honoured ſaint ALDELME for the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd <note place="margin">He is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Bishop of Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne.</note> benefitt, and hauing liberally graunted him verie ample pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueleges and prerogatiues for his monaſteries, diſmiſſed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into his Countrey. Where his fame dayly encreaſing, he was at length found to be the worthieſt to ſucceede <hi>Hedda</hi> biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> to whoſe gouernment then all that Prouince was ſubiect, which now is deuided into fower biſhopricks; <hi>Ciceſter, VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaster, Sherburne</hi> (afterwards tranſlated to <hi>Salſebury)</hi> and <hi>Oxford.</hi> But <hi>Hedda</hi> being dead, it had two biſhops, <hi>Daniel</hi> of <hi>VVincheſter,</hi> and S.

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:15374:266"/>
and obſtinatly he reſiſted, the more eargerly and earneſtly he was deſired. At <hi>Canturbury</hi> therefore by the hands of BRITHWAID the Archbiſhop he was conſecrated and ordayned biſhop of <hi>Sherburne.</hi> When going to <hi>Douer,</hi> he bought of ſome <hi>French</hi> marchants the new and old Teſtaments, a thing of venerable antiquitie, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned at <hi>Malmesbury</hi> vntill our Authours time. But walking then on the ſea ſhore, the mariners, that petulantly derided and ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed at the humilitie and pouertie of the holy man, were ſuddenly, as they ſett out of the hauen, taken with ſuch a horrible tempeſt, that they were ſooner in danger then they were aware of change. Soe that neceſſitie and feare of death compelled them to acknowledge their fault, and call to ſaint ALDELME for helpe. Who entring <note place="margin">He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a tempeſt.</note> into a boate to ſuccour thoſe diſtreſſed creatures, he had noe ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner committed his holy bodie to the ſupportment of the waters, but the winds ceaſed, the ſea was calmed, and thoſe wretched marriners were deliuered out of all danger. Afterwards ſaint ALDELME being returned to his epiſcopall Sea of <hi>Sherburne,</hi> he gouerned his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects with all holines of life, and learning, omitting nothing that belonged to the office and dutie of a moſt holy and learned Prelate. And when he deſired to haue an other to ſucceede him in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie of his monaſterie, his monkes were ſoe bent in affection to him, that during his life they could not be drawne to admitt anie other to be their Abbot. To whoſe will he yeelded, becauſe he knew not how to reſiſt it, and graunted that he being dead they and their ſucceſſours in after ages might freely choſe their Abbot according to the tenour and practiſe of ſainct BENEDICTS Rule. Which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of his was afterwards ratified by the authoritie of a Synod, and of holy King INAS.</p>

                  <label>XVII.</label> IN THE meane time ſaint AVGVSTINE hauing by his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall labour in preaching much enlarged and encreaſed the fayth of CHRIST amongſt the <hi>English,</hi> bent his endeauours to reforme the Church and Biſhops of the <hi>Britans,</hi> who allbeit they had remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the profeſſion of the Catholick fayth euer ſince the time of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> yet was not their fayth ſoe pure but that it was tainted with ſome errours, and eſpecially in the obſeruance of Eaſter, which (contrary to the cuſtom of the Catholick Church) they celebrated from the fourteenth of the moone to the twentith; and manie other things they held, that were repugnant to the vnitie of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church. Therefore ſaint AVGVSTINE, by the aſſiſtance of
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:15374:276"/>
King ETHELBERT, ſummoned the Biſhops and the learned men of the next Prouince of the <hi>Britans</hi> to a parley, at a place called afterwards in the tongue of the <hi>English Saxons,</hi> by the name of <hi>Austens-Oke,</hi> in the confines of the <hi>West-Saxons.</hi> Where he began with a verie gentle and fraternall admonition to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to embrace the Catholique vnitie, and togeather<note place="margin">Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe to be conuerted</note>with him to vndertake the common labour of preaching the Ghoſpell of CHRIST. But he found by experience that it was eaſier to conuert Heathens<note place="margin">the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</note>that had noe knowledge of CHRIST or his Church, then to reduce Schiſmaticks out off their errours to the truth. For after a long diſputation, thoſe ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne <hi>Britans</hi> would not yeeld nether to the prayers, exhortations nor rebukes of ſaint AVGVSTINE and his fellowes; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preferred their owne cuſtoms before all the Churches of the world vnited togeather in CHRIST: Therefore ſaint AVGV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STINE ended this laborious and long controuerſie, ſaying: Let vs beſeech allmightie God to voutchafe to ſhew by heauenly ſignes which tradition is to be followed, yours, or ours. Let a diſeaſed perſon be brought in, and by whoſe prayers he ſhall be cured, let his fayth and workes be beleeued and followed of all. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the aduerſaries vnwillingly accepting, one depriued of all ſight was led in, and placed amongſt them. And when the prayers and labours of the <hi>Britans</hi> could nothing auayle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his cure, ſaint AVGVSTINE compelled by a iuſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, <note place="margin">S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a blind man</note> bowed his knees to the father of our Lord IESVS-CHRIST, humbly beſeeching him to reſtore to that blind creature his loſt ſight, and by the corporall illuminating of one, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle with his ſpirituall grace the hearts of manie of his fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. His prayer being ended, the blind man receaued his ſight, to the great confuſion of his aduerſaries, and comfort of thoſe of his ſide, who with one voyce extolled ſaint AVGVSTINE as the true preacher of the eternall light. And the <hi>Britans</hi> them ſelues confeſſed againſt their wills that indeed the way of iuſtice which AVGVSTINE followed was true; but yet they could not without the conſent and leaue of their countrey renounce their auncient cuſtoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>XVIII.</label> THEREFORE they required a new ſynod to be ſummoned in
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:15374:276"/>
which more of the learned men of their countrey might be preſent. Which being appoynted, ſeauen Biſhops of the <hi>Britans,</hi> and a great <note place="margin">A Synod held in England.</note> number of the learned men (chiefly out of their famous Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>Bangor</hi> then gouerned by an Abbot called <hi>Dinoth)</hi> coming to the place of the councell, went firſt to a certaine holy and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man, that led an anachoreticall life in that countrey, to conſult him whether they ſhould yeeld to the preaching of AVGVSTINE, and abandon their owne tradition? If AVGVSTINE be a man of God (anſwered he) why doe yee not follow his counſell without anie more delay? And by what meanes (replied they) can we proue this? It is written (ſayd the other) <hi>Take my yoake vppon yee, and learne of me,</hi>

                  <hi>becauſe I am meeke, and humble of heart.</hi> If AVGVSTINE then be meeke, and humble in heart, it is likely that he carrieth the yoake of CHRIST, and offers it to be carried by you allſo. But if he be proud, it is manifeſt that he is not from God, and that yee need not care for his ſpeeches. And how (replied they againe) can we be able to know ſoe much? Be ſure (ſayd he) to let him come firſt to the place of the Councell, and yf he humbly ariſe at your entrance, know that he is the Seruant of CHRIST, and to be of you obeyed; but if he contemne you, and diſdaigne to riſe in curteſy to you who are more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, yee may boldly deſpiſe him too. What more? They did <note place="margin">The Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne S.

Which they noe ſooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, but iudging it to proceede out of pride, laboured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict him in all things: refuſing not only to correct their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient errours, but allſoe denying to receaue him for their Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop; conferring with one and other; that yf now he would not daigne to riſe to ſalute vs, how much more will he contemne vs yf we become his ſubiects? To whom the holy man inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">He fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telleth their ruine.</note> with the ſpiritt of propheſie foretould, that becauſe they refuſed to preach with him the way of life to the <hi>English</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by their hands they ſhould feele the reuenge of death. Whoſe words the euent proued true: for after the death of ſaint AVGVSTINE, <hi>Alfrid</hi> King of the <hi>Northumbers</hi> leading forth a great armie againſt the head-ſtrong <hi>Britans,</hi> made a huge ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter amongſt them neere vnto the towne now called <hi>Weſt-Chester.</hi>

What tongue can number how manie troupes of Inſidels, in the confines of <hi>Yorkes</hi> and in all other places where he went, he added to the number of the faythfull, and reduced into the ſhould of CHRISTS holy Church, when only in one day, and that on the feaſt of the natiuitie of our Lord, which the whole multitude of heauenly Angels doeth perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually celebrate, he renewed ten thouſand men in the ſacred baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of life, beſides allmoſt an innumerable multitude of women and children.

AVGVSTINES Tombe, it ſtuck ſoe cloſe to his hands as yf it had been his owne skinne, till ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing asked pardon of the Sainct, he reſtored it againe to the place. Which miracle cloathed him and manie of his fellowes with the white robes of Chriſtianitie, and made them deuoted to ſainct AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVSTINE euer after. <hi>Canutus</hi> King of the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>English</hi> being <note place="margin">Canutus freed from shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prack.</note> at ſea in imminent danger of ſhipracke, calling vppon ſaint AVGV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STINE for helpe (whoſe patronage he had oftentimes proued moſt comfortable) the fearfull tempeſt ceaſed, and he arriued quietly to a ſecure hauen: and coming afterwards to the tombe of his holy Patrone, with the royaltie of manie gratefull rewards and prayſes of thankes, he witneſſed the great fauour he had receaued. The <note place="margin">Speech reſtored to the Dumbe.</note> ſame benefitt was beſtowed vppon manie others in the like caſe, that called to this holy Sainct for ayde. A yong gyrle that (by I know not what miſchance) was ſtrucken dumbe, when all art of phiſicke had been foyled in curing her, offering a candle at ſaint AVGVSTINES tombe, and in heart recommending her ſelf to his merits, perfectly recouered her ſpeech. And the ſame fauour was ſhewed to an other of her ſexe praying in the ſame place. In a word, all manner of diſeaſes were cured at his holy reliques, to thoſe that humbly and religiouſly craued helpe. And as to ſuch he was allwaies mercifully indulgent, ſoe thoſe that endeauoured to wrong him, his tombe, or his Church, eſcaped not the diuine puniſhment.</p>

For being amongſt holy men, and by holy men nurſed and trayned vp in the ſchoole of monaſticall diſcipline, and good learning, paſſing ouer the courſe of his age piouſly with the pious, and innocently with the innocent, he endeauoured with all his power to preſerue him ſelf vnſpotted from the vanitie and corruption of the world.</p>

Vnder theſe holy maſters our BEDE became ſoe great a proficient in laying the foundation of all learning humane and diuine, that afterwards, what with his owne dayly ſtudie and
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:15374:282"/>
diligent labour, both proceeding from a ſharpe witt and ſound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, he attayned to that height of perfection, that he excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the learned men that <hi>England</hi> could euer boaſt off. From <note place="margin">His natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rull incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to learning.</note> his verie infancie he was extremly addicted and delighted with the purenes of an innocent life, and the ſtudie of good ſciences, that he ſeemed, as it were, by the weight of his owne naturall inclination to be drawne and carried to vertue and learning. And togeather with thoſe naturall ſeeds of vertue planted in his ſoule, there ſhined allſoe in him, beyond the force of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane witt, a certaine diuine beame of the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt. He neuer went to his ſtudies but from his prayers, and ſeldom to his prayers but from his ſtudies. For whatſoeuer time he had, that was free from his dayly exerciſe of monaſticall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and from the continuall care of watching, ſinging, and praying night and day in the Church, he was wont wholly and moſt diligently to ſpend in the ſtudie of good learning.

In a word, he exactly learned, ſoundly vnderſtood, fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely retayned, and cleerly taught all good arts and knowleges, that I may boldly ſay, that not only <hi>England,</hi> but the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world in that age could find but few to him comparable, and not one that went beyond him in learning. This manie lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Hiſtoriographers doe teſtifie: this, his owne deeds, and the bookes which he writt ſoe full of all good learning doe manifeſtly auouch.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>III.</label> To the age of thirtie yeares he liued vnder the tutorſhip and obedience of his maſters, the two forenamed Lights of <hi>Canturbury</hi> S.

And that he might be the better prouided and inſtructed exactly to exerciſe all the duties belonging to his epiſcopall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he imparted manie precepts vnto him touching eccleſiaſticall matters, and at his departure gaue him a booke contayning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Popes and auncient Fathers.

               <p>WHEN the bloudie perſecution which the two cruell Emperours <hi>Diocletian,</hi> and <hi>Maximian</hi> rayſed againſt the Catholick Church raged ouer the world, the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thereof was ſoe cruelly outrageous that it could
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:15374:307"/>
not be contayned within the bounds of the Ocean, but powred it ſelf out in crueltie euen into the remoteſt Ilands of the Chriſtian world, and amongſt others into our famous Iland of Great <hi>Britaine.</hi> Where ſaint ALBAN was the captaine and leader of that ſacred war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refare; who being a citizen of the auncient Cittie of <hi>Verulam</hi> (which <note place="margin">The place of his birth.</note> at that time was a Colonie vnder the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours) and borne of a famous ſtock, receaued firſt the Chriſtian fayth by the precepts and inſtructions of the moſt holy martir <hi>Amphibaluss</hi> of whom all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoe we muſt in this hiſtory make often and honourable mention. For after that by preaching he had purchaſed other countreies to CHRIST, being enkindled with an ardent zeale of gayning more and more ſoules to Gods Church, he came to <hi>Verulam,</hi> where firſt with courteous hoſpitalitie he was entertained by our ALBAN as yet a Heathen. But vnderſtanding that his new gueſt <hi>Amphibalus</hi> was <note place="margin">He defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to know the points of fayth.</note> not only a profeſſour but a teacher all ſoe of the Chriſtian name, he was deſirous to heare him diſcourſe of the aſſertion of his fayth, and <hi>Amphibalus</hi> was as eager to giue his Hoſt an accompt thereof, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to winne him to the ſame profeſſion. Therefore he ſhewed him how allmightie God conſiſting of one eſſence &amp; three perſons ſoe dearly loued the world, that he ſent the ſecond perſon in Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie his only Sonne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, as a witnes and meſſenger of his loue, for the reconciliation and redemption of mankind. Who when he was true God of God, yet ſoe farre he humbled him ſelf for our healths ſake, that he voutchſafed to take humane fleſh vppon him, and be borne of a Virgin, allbeit he were the maker and creatour of the ſame fleſh and of his mother the Virgin. And theſe (ſayd he) are the principles of our Fayth, theſe by the inſtruction of the holy Ghoſt were manie ages agoe knowne and foretould by manie of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and ſince confirmed by the wonderfull workes of CHRIST him ſelf, and receaued by the common conſent of allmoſt all nations: and in embracing of theſe points conſiſteth the height of all felicitie, and perpetuall miſerie followeth all that denie them.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>II.</label> BVT at firſt ALBAN ſeemed to laugh at theſe things and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne them, and to hould the teacher of them him ſelf not only to <note place="margin">He laug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heth at the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Fayth.</note> be vaine in his doctrine but allſoe ſcarſe ſound in his witts, in auo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſuch, paradoxes ſoe abhorring (as he thought) from all ſenſe and reaſon. For who can be brought to beleeue (ſayd he) that
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:15374:308"/>
(ſayd he) that God had a Sonne, and the ſame ſoone to be made man, and borne of a Virgin without a father, and ſhe to remaine both a Virgin and a Mother? In ſumme, that daies diſcourſe was broken off, and ALBAN being diſpleaſed with <hi>Amphibalus</hi> and his doctrine, went to pleaſe his troubled mind in his bed: whileſt his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teacher <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> ſorrowfull that his words had taken noe dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per roote in the mind of his kind Hoſt, and ſtill remayning carefull for his ſoules health, betooke him ſelf to his prayers in ſteed of ſleepe: nether was his petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to allmightie God in vaine. For ALBAN being oppreſſed vnder the heauie wings of ſleepe, ſeemed to behould <note place="margin">His viſion being aſleepe.</note> the whole tragedie of our Lords ſacred paſſion ſoe perfectly acted before him, that to his imagination it appeared not ſoe much to be in a dreame, as in very deed repreſented to his corporall ſight. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified therefore out of his ſleepe with the ſtrangenes of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he went forthwith to <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> and deſired him (yf thoſe things which he preached of CHRIST were true) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound allſoe the meaning and interpretation of his dreame. Who (hauing firſt giuen thankes vnto allmightie God for ſoe wonderfull a vocation of his beloued Hoſt) drew out a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix <note place="margin">Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth his dreame.</note> which he allwaies carried about him, and ſhewed in that ſigne how he might plainly vnderſtand what his nightly viſion did portend. And following on with a declaration of CHRISTS Ghoſpell and paſſion, conformeable to what he had ſeene in his ſleepe, he ſoe ſolidly diſcouered the miſtery of CHRIST crucified, that there was noe place for anie doubt left in the mind of ALBAN, ſoe powerfully the holy Ghoſt had planted the truth of fayth in his ſoule. By whoſe ſacred vnction ALBAN <note place="margin">Note the ſtrange &amp; ſuddaine eonuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of S. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban.</note> being wholly repleniſhed with vnuſuall ſweetnes and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mind, deſired now nether teacher nor arguments to inſtruct him, but of his owne accord deteſteth his falſe Gods, abiureth his Idols, profeſſeth to acknowledge no other God, to beleeue no other in his heart, to confeſſe no other with his mouth, but God the father, and his ſonne CHRIST-IESVS, and him crucified. He admireth the greatnes of the diuine pietie and goodnes in the redemption of mankind; and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes wholly to be inflamed with his loue, who voutchſafed
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:15374:308"/>
firſt ſoe to loue humane frailtie, that he vndertooke not only our nature, but allſoe all the miſeries adherent thereunto, as allſo a moſt ſhamefull death it ſelf, to redeeme man from the tirannie of eternall death, to the glorie of Gods elect poeple. Nay falling <note place="margin">He wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippeth the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix.</note> proſtrate before the Croſſe, as yf he had ſeene CHRIST him ſelf really hanging thereon, he embraceth and kiſſeth his wounds, giues him infinite thankes for calling him to the knowledge of his fayth, being wholly carried beyond him ſelf to thinke how to appeare worthily gratefull for the benefitt of ſoe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerued a vocation. Therefore he bad adiew to all worldly pleaſures, and embraced teares and ſighs for his greateſt delights, all other things he contemned, that he might gaine CHRIST alone for all; in him he placed all his hope, and loue; to him he ſoe perfectly vowed him ſelf and all he had, that he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a thouſand times endure to be robbed of this life, then to be ſeparated from the fayth and charitie of his deare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>III.</label> IN the confeſſion of theſe and ſuch like things <hi>Amphiba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> admitted ALBAN to the purifying grace of Baptiſme, and at his <note place="margin">He is baptiſed.</note> earneſt entreatie remayned there ſome daies, more amply to inſtruct him in all things that belonged to the profeſſion of his recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued religion. But in the meane time the renowned name of ALBAN, and the fame of this fact (allbeit ſecretly performed) made, that it came to the eares and knowledge of the enemies of the Chriſtian cauſe, who enuying the aduancement thereof, made complaint vnto the iudge of the cittie. And he forth with commaunded both the maſter and the diſciple to be cited to appeare before him; which cruell-minded decree was ſoone made knowne to ſaint ALBAN. Who deſiring by all meanes to preuent the deceipts of the prince, exhorted <hi>Amphibalus</hi> to <note place="margin">Amphiba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus flieth into Wales.</note> depart ſecretly out of towne, giuing him a rich garment of his owne (which at that time was of great dignitie and reuerence with all men) thereby to paſſe with more ſecurity through his enemies. But he him ſelf retayned his Maſters poore habit for his owne vſe, knowing for certaine that the very ſight thereof would more vehemently incenſe the fury of his and CHRISTS cruell enemies againſt him. Therefore the ſunne had ſcarſe
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:15374:309"/>
cleered the day following, but <hi>Amphibalus</hi> tooke leaue of his deare ſcholler, when the teares ſhed on each ſide, witneſſed the greatnes of their mutuall loue. <hi>Amphibalus</hi> haſtened into <hi>Wales,</hi> there to preach the fayth of CHRIST, and find out a place of Martirdom: and ALBAN cloathed in his maſters weeds, expected the ſame glory at <hi>Ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Till coming to the litle cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage (where he and his Maſter had piouſly ſpent their time the daies before) they found S. ALBAN in a ſtrange habit, barefcot, humbly praying before the ſigne of CHRISTS holy Croſſe. Then ruſhing furiouſly in troupes vppon him, they apprehended him, bound him, and violently haled him, ſome by the garments ſome by the hayre, to the preſence of the Iudge, who at that time in a great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of poeple was byſily employed in offring ſacrifice to his diabolicall Idolls. But ſeeing ALBAN led in that manner, his heart boyled with rage and furie againſt him, becauſe of his owne accord he perceaued him bent to hazard his life for <hi>Amphibalus</hi> whom he had entertayned: Therefore he commaunded him to be drawne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Idolls, threatning to make him ſuffer all the torments due vnto his ſacrilegious gueſt (ſo his wicked tongue termed holy <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibalus)</hi> becauſe as a contemner of the Gods, he had preſumed to conceale him from the officers, and now ſeemed him ſelf to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the profeſſion of his auncient religion. But S. ALBAN <note place="margin">He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth the threats of the Iudge</note> (who had willingly betrayed him ſelf to the perſecutours of the Chriſtian fayth) without anie ſigne of feare, let paſſe the ſtorme of the Princes threats and furie; and armed with the ſhield of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall warrefare, bouldly and plainly affirmed that he would not obey his commaund. Then the Iudge demaunded of what familie and race he was? It appertaines not to thee (anſwered ALBAN) to know my linage, but yf thou deſireſt to vnderſtand the truth of my religion, know that I am a Chriſtian, and one that embraceth all Chriſtian duties. My Parents called me ALBAN, and I adore and worſhip the true liuing God the maker and creatour of all things. Then the Iudge ſwelling with wrath and furie; Yf thou deſire (ſayd he) to enioy the happines of life, offer forthwith ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:15374:309"/>
to our great Gods. Theſe ſacrifices (replied ſainct ALBAN) which by you are offered to deuills, can nether helpe the ſupplicant ſacrificers, nor accompliſh the end of their deſires, but reward them in the end with the euerlaſting torments of Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>V.</label> AT THESE words the Iudge could no longer containe his furie, but commaunded the holy Confeſſor of CHRIST to be cruelly beaten <note place="margin">He is cruelly beaten.</note> and tormented, hoping with ſtripes to ouerthrow the reſolution of his conſtancie, which with words he could not mooue. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lictours executed their office of crueltie vppon his holy bodie in moſt rude manner, when amidſt the noyſe of their pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe whippes, he ioyfully called vppon the name of our Lord IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS-CHRIST, making a willing oblation and ſacrifice of him ſelf to his diuine goodnes: Till the tormentours being wearied with their vaine puniſhing, and he nothing wearied with conſtant ſuffering, the poeple obtayned to haue him impriſoned for the ſpace of ſix <note place="margin">He is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to priſon.</note> moneths, hoping that time would weare out the purpoſe of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. In the meane while the heauens witneſſed the iniury done to the holy Martir; for from the firſt day of his apprehenſion to the day of his martirdom, ſuch an intollerable drought by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of the ſunnes heate raged in that Prouince, that the fruicts of the earth were quite burnt vp and deſtroyed. Which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens (whoſe hearts neuertheleſſe were frozen vp againſt the holy flames of true charitie) iudged to be done by the art magick of the impriſoned Chriſtian. Therefore the wiſeſt of the countrey being aſſembled togeather to diſcuſſe this point, ſaint ALBAN was called out of the horrour of the priſon to anſwer for him ſelf at the barre <note place="margin">He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed.</note> of their examination. And being found, <hi>Not guiltie,</hi> they all grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the iniurie, and ſuffered in his ſufferings; in ſoe much that a ſedition being riſen amongſt the citizens and his friends, all ſtood vp in his defence, and freed him out of his beloued chaines (by which they thought him iniured, hauing all waies had the name and fame of a man of good life) that he might render an accompt of his deeds before the Iudge.

Then aroſe a great contention amongſt them in defining with what kind of death to puniſh him, ſome as a diſciple of the Crucifix iudged him to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, others would haue him buried aliue, as enemie to their Gods, the reſt thought fitt to haue his eyes digged out and ſent ſoe to ſeeke out his Maſter <hi>Amphibalus.</hi> In fine, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the thronging multitudes of poeple that haſtened to ſee this ſtrange ſpectacle were ſoe great, that coming to a large riuer ouer which they muſt paſſe to the hill, the bridge being not able to receaue them, manie that for haſt endeauoured to wade or ſwimme ouer, were by the furie of thoſe wild ſtreames carried downe to an vntimely death. Meane while S. ALBAN much grieued in mind to ſee the ruine of thoſe periſhing ſoules, and perceauing his iourney to the deſired place of martirdom to be hindered by that huge concourſe of poeple, fell downe on his knees, and humbly made his prayer to him whoſe ſide flowed water and bloud for the redemption of the world, to giue a ſafe paſſage to that poeple ſoe deſirous to be preſent at his death.

For throwing away his ſword that ſhould haue done that blouddie deed, he fell proſtrate at the holy Martirs feet, confeſſed his errour, and humbly demaunded pardon; crying alowd that there was noe other true God but the God of the Chriſtians, and earneſtly deſiring to die in ſteed of him whom he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded

Therefore becauſe AMPHIBALVS teacheth theſe things we ought rather to honour his vertue with all due reuerence, and with benefitts to requite him labouring for the common good, then ſoe vngratefully and cruelly to perſecute his innocencie.

Soe that the earth, which is wont to corrupt and conſume the dead bodies of other mortall men, ſerued here as a ſoueraigne baulme not only to preſerue her virginall fleſh vncorrupted, but euen to cure and heale the wounds made therein.
